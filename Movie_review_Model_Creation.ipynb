No words. No words can describe this. I will try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives into their toasters... after watching this show.This... Cosgrove person... Her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance upon the nest of highly agitated insects. Perhaps I exaggerate. However, I have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show.The characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun on any day of the week. Though heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them act like fools on the cheaply built sets, I have no doubt that it will happen eventually.The main plot of this *belches loudly into the faces of the actors* is that of a foolish girl who hosts a live weekly web-cast on the creatively titled iCarly.com with her brainless friends, one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn\\'t afford. Her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brother.I haven\\'t watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer, or perhaps a cold, but some of the plot points I have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator, the doorman of the apartment almost dieing, and the world\\'s fattest priest coming for a visit. No, really.Avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma. If you do decide to watch it, laugh when the laugh-track tells you to, as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long. The show receives a one star rating because the IMDb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers.\",neg\\r\\n\"this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children, she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house. when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it. not much suspense, it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film. at the beginning, when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. whats up with that? the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert. even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy. don\\'t waste your time with this. nuff said\",neg\\r\\n\"This is a terrible movie, and I\\'m not even sure why it\\'s so terrible. It\\'s ugly, for one, with that trendy 1970s visual style that maybe seemed like a good idea at the time but which now enables one to instantly recognize a film from that time period as being a 70s product. The film retains the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on screen. But mostly, the movie sucks because of the wan performance of Lucille Ball, who you\\'d think would be able to make something of this larger-than-life character if anyone could. She sleepwalks through the movie like a terrified actress choking on her opening night, and the film sinks with her. Even Bea Arthur, who I bet was hilarious in the best friend role onstage, can\\'t breathe any life into this stinker.Avoid at all costs.Grade: D\",neg\\r\\n\"First of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically. Some kind of combination between \"\"American Beauty\"\" and \"\"As Good as it gets\"\". And of course something specifically to all Russian movies ( of course the valuable one, no dirty propaganda !) : the problem of loneliness of man ... Especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all vomitive propaganda about communism ( both positive or negative propaganda ! ). A movie about common people, their problems, lack of satisfactions - especially for young ones, fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society ... and about the fake \"\"solutions\"\" : alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution : true love ... Of course it\\'s very well \"\"located\"\" in the space and time of \"\"Russian perestroika\"\" but it\\'s valid for all the society ( except a perfect one, but don\\'t worry - not possible to find this on our Earth !). For the last time - definitely recommended ...\",pos\\r\\n\"As a young lass, beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was orphaned, after her \"\"stool pigeon\"\" father was shot to death.

Woodbury rooms with understanding songstress Linda Ware (as Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends John Archer (as Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (as Mickey Roman). But, none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam, which lands her in prison. Upon release, Woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money\\xc2\\x85 Re-titled \"\"Gangs, Inc.\"\", this is an obviously weak, cheap mobster melodrama. Still, it\\'s a lot of fun to watch Woodbury work wonders with inferior material. She plays the innocent growing more sophisticated \"\"Rita\"\" quite convincingly; and, she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker. Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past. \"\"Paper Bullets\"\" also features an early Alan Ladd (as Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan). Ms. Ware, who sang the hit \"\"An Apple for the Teacher\"\" with Bing Crosby, sings a couple of fair \\'40s numbers nicely. But, mainly, it\\'s Woodbury\\'s show.**** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd\",neg\\r\\n\"Low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story. This movie is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The alluring Tania Frankenstein(Sara Bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father\\'s estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein(Joseph Cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. This is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. Still a fun watch.\",neg\\r\\n\"Just to save you the $3, or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store, and the anguishing hour-and-however-long-this-movie-is here\\'s a simple plan. Go over to a friend\\'s house, talk them into renting The Pest for you, watch the first 30 seconds or so and then make up some excuse to leave. The opening sequence is really funny, definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. Without the shower scene at the beginning this is one of the worst movies of all time.\",neg\\r\\n\"If you want to see a film starring Stan laurel from the Laurel & Hardy comedies, this is not the film for you. Stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of those films for another two years. If, however, you want a good travesty of the Rudolph Valentino BLOOD AND SAND, which had been made the previous year, this is the movie for you. All the stops are pulled out, both in physical comedy and on the title cards and if the movie is not held together by character, the plot of Valentino\\'s movie is used -- well sort of.\",pos\\r\\n\"I am willing to tolerate almost anything in a Sci-Fi movie, but this was almost intolerable. While a few of the special effects are very cool (landscapes) this is no \\'battlespace\\' rather a disjointed weird mother/daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts thrown in. The acting (wooden), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and with \"\"hand-to-hand\"\" combat scenes funnier than any Hong Kong chopsocky movie, this film bores. The plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator), unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea. Save your love of Sci-Fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here.\",neg\\r\\n\"This was so bad, I want God to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it.First off, the acting was uniformly bad. There was barely a plot, unless \"\"Shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog\"\" counts.The editing was was all over the place, and the slow-mo shots of the \"\"gore\"\" (red corn syrup flying through the air--doubtless flung using a spoon) got irritating after the tenth time, and infuriating after the hundredth time.I like Michael Rooker. He\\'s done some good work. This was not good. This was less than good. And by that, I mean that it sucked.

Certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark, and the acting occasionally goes over the top. But the underlying message - about God\\'s and others\\' forgiveness for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in cinema, and the cast is very very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so effectively done that, years after having seen it, I still get chills thinking about it. Highly recommended.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. The daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. The on-location scenery is absorbingly authentic, and the soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving. This film is a graduate-level course in a reality that\\'s too little recognized in American society. Personally, I\\'m freaked out by the names of the characters -- Lange\\'s character is Ginny Cook Smith -- my name is Connie Cook Smith, and my mom is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, which is my sister\\'s name, and the father is Larry Cook, my cousin\\'s name.But sex abuse was not in our immediate family.\",pos\\r\\n\"Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn\\'t really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake. Still, it\\'s business as usual for dead-camper movies.There are much better films in this vein, but over all The Prey may be watchable enough for die-hard slasher fans. Although one might be more rewarded to watch Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983) again.* 1/2 out of ****\",neg\\r\\n\"So after years and years I finally track this film down! I was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. I distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft, just staring out with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, I remember chills running down my spine. Watching it now, its obviously nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. If anyone wants a copy, private message me.The story itself is fairly standard BCFF stuff. Its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around - there is no real moral as such (except that \\'ghosts are here to help us?\\' or \\'don\\'t be prejudiced against ghosts!\\') There wasn\\'t even a greed/capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. However, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. The captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. Its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. Oh well.\",pos\\r\\n\"Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his \"\"idol\\'s\"\" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it. Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It did make me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met up with Chris in Seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk. If anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.\",pos\\r\\n\"Terrible direction from an awful script. Even the DVD looked muddy and out of focus. Laughable accents all over the map. Unlike most of the other commenters I had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud, but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn-out shots of nude or scantily-clad young men, usually wet or glistening with sweat, looking longingly at each other.\",neg\\r\\n\"I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film. Trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.There were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and Kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the World Championship. There were other shots of Kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where Deep Blue was located. This just looked like filler.Also, I didn\\'t find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and seeing an IBM techie trying, unsuccessfully to \\'open\\' it. What would we have seen of interest inside anyway - a little grandmaster?Also, the recent match against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was. It would have been nice to have been told: was this a one-off \\'just for the money\\'? Was it part of the world championship cycle? What was the final score? The nub of the film was the play in game two. Could/would IBM let Kasparov see \\'inside\\' the machine? That\\'s where the focus should have been.\",neg\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book! This felt like a bad High School film project), acting was about as clich\\xc3\\xa9 as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an LA freeway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clich\\xc3\\xa9s: The pregnant astronaut\\'s wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone\\'s way, the stalwart manager with \"\"Go Fever\"\". And it\\'s one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story, but at least make it GOOD! Fact and science were totally butchered for this. The space shuttle doesn\\'t have fuel tanks in it\\'s wings, and even if it did, it couldn\\'t steer by shifting fuel between them (and neither could a DC-10).If you like bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism, and cheesy clich\\xc3\\xa9s, this one can\\'t be beat!\",neg\\r\\n\"I just saw this movie for the first time last night. Wow! What a movie! This is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting.I do not want to give a single word about the plot because I think it would be better for people to go in cold. DO NOT READ THE PLOT SUMMARY before you see the movie! All I\\'m going to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson, and the screenplay by Jeff Maguire are top notch. I wish all thrillers were more like this one.\",pos\\r\\n\"Saw the film at it\\'s Lawrence, Kansas premiere. This wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful. It fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. But mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - \"\"Hey I have some money, so let\\'s make a movie!\"\" - without really thinking it out. Sorrowfully most indie films that don\\'t make it suffer from just that mentality. They just don\\'t seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie... or in this case, even a watchable one. With this film I do not feel ashamed to say, that if I didn\\'t know some of the crew, I would have walked out. Simple as that.\",neg\\r\\n\"SHRIEKER is a Full Moon production. I knew what to expect (very little quality) but I didn\\'t expect this to be as painful as SHRIEKER was to watch.It\\'s just awful. Bad acting, confusing script and direction. Annoying characters I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably made in one week. I\\'ve seen episodes of CHARMED that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie.It has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived TV series no one has ever seen. It was a chore to watch and I could feel my mind getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute. Watching a movie shouldn\\'t be this much hard work.\",neg\\r\\n\"The first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the Willis character were pretty enjoyable, especially with Jean Smart, but it really tanked after that. This is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all. I know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self, but I found this kid ESPECIALLY irritating and whinney.\",neg\\r\\n\"Early Jackie Chan film where there is no sign of the Chan persona we know. This is Chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China. Its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to super stardom. Its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. As a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie. I was watching it, in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that I watched that day had I not noticed Jackie in the film. Honestly I don\\'t think the film is really worth bothering with (there are too many other better variations) except if you\\'re interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.\",neg\\r\\n\"I thought that the interplay between Crystal and DeVito was great. The movie is rather off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. Ramsey as \"\"Momma\"\" is vulgar and over the top, but also very funny and effective. The character HAS to be pretty awful for why else would someone entertain thoughts of killing his mother? Now Crystal\\'s wife -- she is a \"\"slut\"\" whom everyone would like to receive her comeuppance, thus her role, though minor, is also effective, because it has to justify Crystal\\'s ridiculous case of \"\"writer\\'s block.\"\" While there are certainly dark moments, the movie is not depressing and, despite the murderous urges that the protagonists feel, they have redeeming qualities too.Overall, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember, one that I don\\'t mind watching over several times.\",pos\\r\\n\"The Ali G character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a movie, it doesn\\'t work in the same way.Don\\'t get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of biting, witty dialogue, that caricatures the modern British chav wonderfully well, whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious, if unrealistic story.One problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant, or it\\'s embarrassing to watch. When I say embarrassing, I don\\'t mean funny embarrassing a la Office or Extras, but rather, you\\'ll wish they hadn\\'t included it in the final cut. One example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended, to the tune of, \"\"This is how we do it.\"\" Whenever I watch the film, I stop the DVD when it says the end, and leave it at that.Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a good film, worth watching a couple of times. The script is enjoyable to an extent, and there are no issues as far as acting goes. However, refinement is the key word here.Ali G is a better television programme. Borat is a better film.\",pos\\r\\n\"I must admit that I didn\\'t get around to seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn\\'t help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it?\"\"Return to Me\"\" has a lovely and simple story at its core, and is extremely well-directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself....along with this one!) The charming story is beautifully woven with clever comedy and brought to life with superb performances by veteran as well as younger actors.To those who say that David Duchovny hasn\\'t really had a good shot at breaking out of his \"\"Fox Mulder\"\" mold, I agree. I\\'ve seen his other film work, and is, by far, the best thing he could have done for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny, and lively in her role as Grace.Outside of these two leads, however, you are surrounded by Grace\\'s close-knit family and friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute stitch, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real-life force. I cannot, however, go without mentioning the talents of Robert Loggia, and the dearly departed Carroll O\\'Connor. Ironically, I watched this film again on DVD only the day before he passed away. This was his last film, and he gave a performance that an actor of his calibre could certainly be proud to leave as the finale to a great career.Overall, \"\"Return To Me\"\" turned what would have still been just a fun love story, and grew it into a film that has become one of my favorites! Take the time rent this one.....it\\'s well worth the effort!\",pos\\r\\n\"The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way.As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn\\'t pass this film on to Miramax - not because it\\'s particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults. This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children - it is lumped in with trailers for \"\"Rugrats the Movie\"\", and \"\"Pokemon 2000\"\" (aren\\'t they passe yet?). But I quibble.I was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter - rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a Porsche convertible and acting like a moron, Willis\\' character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life. His guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at age 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives and frankly, I didn\\'t care). Young Rusty\\'s innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in divining the truth - he sums up Russell\\'s job as an image consultant thusly, \"\"You teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren\\'t\"\". In order for a good script to succeed, however, you need actors to bring it to life. Not a problem here.Although Willis has thrice ignored W.C. Fields\\' warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again, meshing as well comedically with Breslin as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance Russell\\'s cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. Breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone\\'s childhood - the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on. We also get two bonus performances: Lily Tomlin is great as Russell\\'s levelheaded assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman (I loved her in \"\"Guinevere\"\").The Kid is charming, heavy, and real. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a European film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of DV. The film works because it\\'s in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other UK realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes. The performances are strong, particularly Maureen Carr as the mother, Trise. I understand the film has recently been released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, which is why I gave it a high score because the filmmaker, May Miles Thomas obviously put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for her amazing achievement.\",pos\\r\\n\"I like the phrase \"\"British post war suburban paranoia\"\" that one of the reviewers used. It describes so well the kind of films John Mills excelled in (\"\"The October Man\"\" (1947), \"\"The Long Memory\"\" (1952)) in between \"\"big\"\" pictures (\"\"Scott of the Antartic\"\" (1948) and \"\"War and Peace\"\" (1956)).This distinctly \"\"Eric Ambler\"\" style plot had John Mills playing Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises his friend, Charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport. A creepy \"\"reporter\"\" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down Windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting!!! (something fishy is going on!!!). Howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it.The next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work, further more, he finds his friend Charles could not have rung him as he is still in New York and Windsor doesn\\'t seem to exist. Earlier on a patient, Mrs Ambler(Rene Ray) who has been referred to him by Doctor George Kimber (Mervyn Johns) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. It is a nightmare that is coming true for Howard but of course when Detective Inspector Dane (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of Howard\\'s Daimler.When Howard is lying low, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself a \"\"friend\"\" - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches Frieda gave Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the flat, Charles rings and while Howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches!!! Who can he trust - who hasn\\'t something to hide!!!This is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as \"\"The October Man\"\", but with John Mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!Highly Recommended.\",pos\\r\\n\"I have just finished watching this movie, and for me.... it takes ages to finish because it is so boring.....and the storyline is extremely bad.now... where should i start....O.... the movie is called \"\"sinking of japan\"\" ....yeah yeah... it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad. Compare to the movie \"\"the day after tomorrow\"\" i would have rate it at least 8/10.The \"\"sinking of Japan\"\" does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes. there isn\\'t much excitement at all...boring... all i can say...one more point... i would recommend this movie to have a better title... maybe something like \"\"the romance of sinking of japan\"\" because this movie does have lots of talkings (waste of time... talk nonsense) & the love story is extremely boring & have been dragging too long...honestly.. i almost get frustrated.Overall... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e.g. many people running like hell to avoid death..love story part was extremely not touching enough for me.but hey... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though.... & its has got good songs!\",neg\\r\\n\"I watched this movie so that you don\\'t have to! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking? He did this for scale? At least the film\\'s title practices truth in advertising, since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, adding to the confusion. Kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn\\'t sure if Genevieve Bujold\\'s character really existed. This does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story!The \"\"making of\"\" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. It explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie, even as the film is being shot.To it\\'s credit, this movie is visually pleasing and doesn\\'t in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1M. Too bad the money wasn\\'t spent on a better project.\",neg\\r\\n\"By the standards of Hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within Hollywood. Thats where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends. This was THE WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen in MY LIFE! I am not joking. The story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film. I know what you\\'re saying, \"\"its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it\\'s supposed to scare you.\"\" Well let me tell you something, the movie is not even scary in the least bit. Its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been. The acting was awful as well, along with the scariness of the murderer, who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off. Throughout the movie I kept getting a sense I was watching something that was thought up, written, produced, and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography. Please, don\\'t see this movie, spend your $8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be much more worth your while.\",neg\\r\\n\"The movie is an adaptation of a Japanese story by the respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply doesn\\'t make the transition into a credible story about Brits and Americans.The story moves sluggishly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship\\'s prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. The film moves so languidly that I even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate or erotic. The film did achieve a measure of notoriety when Kristofferson\\'s then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the filming. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn\\'t quite the same for a viewer.There are no characters to hang on to. The sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable. Kristofferson is amiable enough, but he just doesn\\'t have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although perhaps we don\\'t really want get too involved with him, considering his ultimate fate.As for the little kid, well, he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum\\'s life. Now this is a really bad crowd. They don\\'t just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. They slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. This is shown in gory detail. But of course, this is only practice so they can do the same thing to Kristofferson!So the movie mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid.The ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you\\'ll ever see.This all might have made some sense if the Japanese locale and cultural context had been retained. As it stands, it is just abysmal.\",neg\\r\\n\"I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish. My aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time - and money - wisely.I also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage, and want to publicize the fact that the director/producer of these garbage films can\\'t get away with it for very long. We will find out who you are and will vote with out feet - and wallets.This film clearly falls into the garbage category.The director and writer is John Shiban. It\\'s always a bad sign when the writer is also the director. Maybe he wants two pay cheques. He shouldn\\'t get any. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see anything else by him, forget it.I won\\'t say anything about the plot - others have already. I am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girl\\'s face when she is crying and screaming. These long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of Mr. Shiban. Maybe he should get psychiatric help.Enough already. It\\'s crap - don\\'t waste your time on it.\",neg\\r\\n\"I thought this was very \"\"different\"\" compared to most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly. It would not be useful for those studying it at school etc. as it does not show the traditional Shakespeare character interpretations (i.e- Miranda is portrayed quite punky compared to your traditional Shakespeare lady) but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch. It does not include also the correct format, as in the layout of acts and scenes as I am currently playing Miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and I would definitely recommend it as a must-see even if just to say you\\'ve seen it! Shakespeare fans would love this!\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie was horrible. If it had never been made the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying wagon? What were they thinking? This was a sub-par movie with a horrible hook, and I would like a written apology from the studio that produced this, along with some cookies to help repay me for the time I wasted on this crap fest that I can never get back. If you payed to see this movie, I am truly sorry because I watched it on TV on a Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week. A flying freaking WAGON?!?! And that\\'s supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own screwed up needs than her children? No wonder they don\\'t have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them, their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else. Absolutely horrible.\",neg\\r\\n\"In the final days of the year 1999, most everyone in Taiwan has died. A strange plague has ravished the island. Supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like the insects. Eventually, they die. The Hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building (which is especially well created; kudos to the set designer!). Its two protagonists live right above and below each other. The woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to go check it out, and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the man\\'s apartment. The two have never met before, and they come into contact through the hole.The script is quite brilliant. Few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai\\'s direction is simply beautiful. Like a lot of other Taiwanese directors, he uses a lot of long takes. But unlike, say, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai doesn\\'t overuse them. In fact, I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever seen them used better. They\\'re always effective and never tedious. It would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and a great one, at that. In the film\\'s best scenes - which is saying something, considering how good all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are fully choreographed, often with backup dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius, Tsai has these elaborately produced numbers take place in the crumbling building, the signs of apocalypse and decay unhidden. This provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity.The Hole is a film that begs to be seen. It ought to be a cult classic, if nothing else. Before I went to see this, I was told that it was a decent film, but probably Tsai Ming-liang\\'s least good one. Well, if that is true, I just cannot wait to see another one! 10/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"While i read all of the complaints about this movie before i saw it, i still had interest from the preview. I don\\'t know if it was because i was expecting a bomb or what, but i really enjoyed the movie. The I was not very frightened at all until the second half of the movie, but even then it wasn\\'t very bad at all. I think that most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic, if a little too coincidental, but it was necessary to move the story along. I think that the house and surrounding area is the perfect setting for this type of movie, it is beautiful and huge, but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary. I also think that the light arrangement worked extremely well because not only did they turn on upon entry, but there was no way to keep them on, so the house stayed dark outside of the small section Jill was in.Speaking of Jill, i thought her part was acted pretty well, at first it wasn\\'t as believable, but after a few phone calls it was fine. In fact the scenes where she is frightened are acted perfectly. And, finally, someone got the fire poker right. I can\\'t tell you how many times when i hear a noise at my house i grab the fire poker, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same, even though she idiotically forgets it when she needs it most.In regards to the plot holes, the movie is not perfect but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the mystery is how he got in..exactly, how long was he watching her? how did he get out to kill her friend? and when exactly did the gardener die? overall, i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went. It kept my attention, and i wanted to see how it ended, although the ending was very brief and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, other than the ending, was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her situation more, to give us a taste of her personality and to give us foreshadowing to how she will handle the situation(for example, the scene where she debates whether to go back for the kids, it looks like some scene is missing at the beginning that talked about her only caring about herself or something).\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.It\\'s very different in that it\\'s kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). I won\\'t reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it\\'s very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.Don\\'t miss this movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'m a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you\\'d expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.If you read the \"\"scholars\"\" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it\\'s all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If that is indeed the point, then Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. The central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the church\\'s fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones to blame.There are a few moments where you might cry, \"\"Aha! surrealism!\"\": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in B/W). The rest is forgettable self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm...). If you\\'re interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau\\'s early work.\",neg\\r\\n\"The recent documentary \"\"The Adventures of Errol Flynn\"\" is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart,Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. If he hadn\\'t been under contract to Warner Bros. he would\\'ve of been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he\\'s a predator. And he could\\'ve starred with his best leading ladies sister Joan Fontaine. That was Flynn\\'s trouble he was the Ultimate Screen Hero until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him. Grant and Flynn in a way are similar but Flynn was the more macho of the two;it is possible to see Grant as Captain Blood but Flynn in The Philadelphia Story Mr. Blanding Builds his Dream House,or Monkey Business,or Operation Petticoat would\\'ve turned those roles on their collective ears because he\\'s too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would\\'ve brought naturally would\\'ve made the story lines wobbly. But this wobbly biography is just a plasticized view of Flynn and his era. There are times when I half expected a laugh track or an audience to go \"\"Ahhh\"\" at some point. It doesn\\'t go deeply into Flynn\\'s life just the screen magazine view. It also doesn\\'t delve into his struggle to be considered more than a derring-doer. Like the cleaned up biographies of Lon Chaney( the father,not the Wolfman,or Lenny\"\"Of Mice and Men) and Buster Keaton done in the \\'50\\'s this is just a time killing piece of fluff\",neg\\r\\n\"This film IS brilliant...... without a doubt. Watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which I am not), and thought it was quite good. But after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it IS good.Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. Yeah right, you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth.That is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from Prot, pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) A great film... that get\\'s you wondering.....8/10 Dave\",pos\\r\\n\"Low budget horror about an evil force. Hard to believe in this day and age, but way back when this stuff actually used to get theatrical release! These days this sort of thing would either go direct-to-video or straight to cable. Shouldn\\'t be too hard to avoid this one; who\\'s ever heard of it?\",neg\\r\\n\"I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren\\'t stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic!), than the man alone...) and to link the \"\"adventures\"\" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying \"\"Oh, a boat!\"\") were awful. At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the middle-high class, even in an excessive way. I think it is a lousy movie. If you want to watch it, do it as a film school student, trying to see technical aspects and issues. It will help a lot.\",neg\\r\\n\"Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave this a frightening, Expressionistic look. Scenes are shot at weird angles -- especially scenes involving figurative and literal lady-killer Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior presages another superb, medium-budget movie, \"\"The Stepfather,\"\" by more than two decades.The entire cast is excellent, though (though no fault of her own) it\\'s hard to think of Joyce Compton as anyone but the singer in \"\"The Awful Truth.\"\") Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp (especially, and though playing an older woman looking gorgeous) -- they couldn\\'t have been topped.Setting a creepy lodger-in-the-house-of women story against a background of psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off beautifully.

But Scott is dispatched too quickly.

That would not have impeded the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss finally getting together.\",pos\\r\\n\"Along with Cops, The Goat is one of Keaton\\'s two funniest shorts.

This attitude does Americans no favours in the Big Wide World out here.It was bad enough that \"\"The Wicker Man\"\" was remade and set in the USA ,totaly stripped of its Cultural context, and with a Polticaly Correct gender change for a leading Character.One wonders what next,Robert The Bruce as a New York cop ?,Mary Queen of Scots as a \"\"Soccer Mom\"\" juggling ,kids ,a career and relationships ?Come on Hollywood, open up to all the other Cultures on the Planet!\",neg\\r\\n\"What can I say about this film that won\\'t give you any preconceived notions when you see it? Very little. The plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down. What follows after that is the movie. It is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years. Everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended. It is not a perfect film. The film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story, even more confused.(If you\\'ve read any number of other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere you\\'ll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on) I\\'m not sure what I actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have. If you like horror, and don\\'t mind not having everything clearly summed up I suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl.\",pos\\r\\n\"I wish that all the mockumentaries and horror spoofs would go away. If you are going to investigate loch ness..do it for real. Enough of the bull****.

I hate when watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for their life(or running or whatever..their life is at stake) and they are cracking jokes. This never happens..cmon where have all the good directors gone? I think horror and sci-fi have really gone down the tube since the 70\\'s.

I have seen a couple of the Japanese horror films, Ringu and Juon, and loved them; but this movie was a disappointment. It never even explained anything about the curse. I just didn\\'t see any horror... it wasn\\'t scary to me at all. The whole time I was watching I was waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now. If this was some ancient curse, why didn\\'t it happen before Shuichi\\'s father? And it never told us what happened to her father. I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended.

In this case, the death was a suicide, an event that nearly always poisons the emotional well of the survivors in a particularly corrosive way. We follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months.The father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a withdrawn, virtually mute, usually drunken stiff who secretly takes leave from his job for months, sits instead on a park bench all day, and insists on setting a full plate of food at the deceased son\\'s place for every meal. He treats everyone else in the family with unerring nastiness. He sees his doctor regularly but the issue of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never comes up.The mother (Sigourney Weaver) yells at the neighbor woman, among others, gets busted when she stupidly tries to buy \"\"marijuana\"\" (her term) at a head shop (what adult in reality would ever try such a dumb stunt?), and, near the end, swoons into coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer (she\\'s a heavy smoker). Ms. Weaver has a few flip lines but generally behaves too unintelligently to merit much empathy. It\\'s not that there aren\\'t people out there who behave in these silly ways when severely stressful circumstances arise. But why make a film of such drivel? What can anyone learn from this pair\\'s conduct? The deceased\\'s older sister (Michelle Williams) is away at college and all too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is genuine, its causes multifold, and his conduct is coherent within the circumstances. But Hirsch\\'s character is too soft spoken, too morose and beaten down, to carry the movie. The other bit players, subtexts and cutesy, unreal dialogue don\\'t help.The suicide theme is echoed in an almost nonchalant manner in the case of two other minor characters. So what is the writer-director, Dan Harris, trying to say about this subject? That it isn\\'t a serious matter? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play the sap of a father as written in this screenplay is something only his therapist might possibly be able to answer. Avoid this dog. Instead rent Redford\\'s classic.

The storyline was dull and unconvincing as were the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film. Charlie had changed, and now, he has a girlfriend. The first film had some good music, but the music in this film was unmemorable. In short, this film just did not do it for me. And, looking at other user feedback, it looks like it didn\\'t do it for a lot of you. It\\'s not worth watching.\",neg\\r\\n\"The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. All the technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, acting, directing, pacing, etc). The STORY is breathtaking.Seemingly beyond death, our main character finds himself inhabiting a world without beauty, passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationships are numb and uninspiring, and when it all becomes too much, he seeks to end it in front of a train. But it doesn\\'t end - he can not leave this strange world by suicide! Working his way back to a man who seemed to be feeling he same isolation and loneliness, our main character joins him in excavating a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music. Just as they break through - and I will not reveal THAT much, it all comes to an end and the movie ends as oddly as it began.Suffice it to say you will either love this movie or hate it. I feel that it is like a magical poem - open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next. If you enjoy new experiences in film and want to be taken away from Hollywood\\'s crap-feast, try this movie!9/10 (and I don\\'t rate easily!) because in spite of its darkness, this movie left me with a sense of something greater...something mysterious and beyond ourselves.

Guess who\\'s playing this minor role, yup!

There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn\\'t for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook\\'s (President) talents were never realized in this movie. Shatner\\'s acting is okay.

Perhaps because, by its very nature, those talented in the field of Irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in Britain or America, (Colin Farrell is a recent case in point), and that the really successful Irish directors that have continued to work in Ireland and with Irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market. I am thinking particularly of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan who alternate between films with an Irish setting and projects filmed abroad.\"\"Middletown\"\", however, is very much an Irish film even if two of its principal actors are English. It\\'s certainly well-made of its kind and might have bucked the trend that Irish films aren\\'t really very good; (Paddy Breathnach\\'s \"\"I Went Down\"\", written by the brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately this tale of fundamentalism set in a fictitious Irish town, presumably in the North of Ireland judging by the accents, (Mid-Ulster Bible-Belt, if you ask me), and presumably in the recent past, (the fifties? the sixties?), is so over-the-top that it really is quite ridiculous.Nothing in the film rings true and you can\\'t help feeling it\\'s writer, Daragh Carville, has been strongly influenced by Flannery O\\'Connor and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the American bible-belt and not in Ireland where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist was never quite as loony as this. It\\'s all meant be to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way and it certainly is, though I was more prone to giggles than frisson\\'s at the right Reverand Matthew Macfayden\\'s antics. He has the Ulster accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays\\' wife but the script is so appallingly derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film. So rather than a step up the ladder for Irish cinema \"\"Middletown\"\" is, I\\'m afraid, just another nail in its coffin.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka.

Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi) blames him for the death of his mother in the delivery, and also that his father loves and prefers Hassam to him. In return, Amir feels a great respect for his father\\'s best friend Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir winning a competition of kitting, Hassam runs to bring a kite to Amir, but he is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef (Elham Ehsas) in an empty street to protect Amir\\'s kite; the coward Amir witness the assault but does not help the loyal Hassam. On the day after his birthday party, Amir hides his new watch in Hassam\\'s bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire Ali, releasing his conscience from recalling his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of Baba. Later Amir meets his countrywoman Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and they get married. In 2000, after the death of Baba, Amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the terminal Rahim Khan, who discloses secrets about his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, in Pakistan, in a journey of redemption.I am not familiar with the Afghan culture and I did not read this novel in spite of the recommendation of my daughter, and yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief insight in the recent history of Afghanistan, from a peaceful period in the 70\\'s to the present days with the Taliban. The actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. The arid locations in China recall the images we see in television from Afghanistan.

Two brothers, real-life ones (one of them being Marc Recha himself), re-enact a fictional version of a real-life journey they had made through the spectacular Catalan countryside, and history is evoked (pans of bullet-holed walls, artillery booms on the soundtrack) but not shown. There is very little dialog, and most of it is incidental: the story is told in a third-person voice-over, the voice being that of an actress impersonating the real-life sister of the real-life brothers. The images have little to do with what story line there is, which isn\\'t much. Many are stunning, brooding pans across stark semi-arid mountains and rivers (think Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant -- there\\'s not a little of both \"\"Gerry\"\" and \"\"Last Days\"\" here), interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames. These are best enjoyed within the film\\'s superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music (some quite good, some rather odd, but all gratuitous). The best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences, with their occasional comment-less inclusion of power stations and dams.The relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic; a major character is a man-biting catfish, never shown. The more the Catalano-nationalist anarcho-whateverist commitments of the director are suggested, the more the film\\'s richer, unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes. Though the director said at the NYFF screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its third-person narrative, I\\'d like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog -- the result might be more moving, and would in any case not be that much less baffling.Meantime, this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object (the bathing suit he had been wearing?) dangling from his penis. This is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is (sorry) pricked by something that\\'s actually happening on screen (what is that? why\\'s it hanging there?), but, as usual, no answers are provided. Very Warholian, very sixties, and a not a little tiresome.\",neg\\r\\n\"Nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account other Barker\\'s movies, which never lack originality.

The characters are still fun: Buster Crabbe is every bit the blonde dreamboat hero and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still plots to steal Flash for herself, King Vultan of the Hawk Men still has his booming laugh and angel wings, and Ming the Merciless, Emperor of the Universe, is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps.This serial probably wouldn\\'t interest children today with its hokey effects - oh, that spaceship! - but it\\'s a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around. The actors play it straight and don\\'t play down to kids. I appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter synopses which had pretty big words in them.I\\'m glad this came out on DVD. It\\'s a lot of fun to revisit this classic sci-fi serial.\",pos\\r\\n\"The story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a Birthday Party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other. They proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift, it was almost like, \\'I hope she likes it\\'! There is a killing in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart,(Julia Kerbridge),\"\"Reaper\"\",2000, gets involved with the case because of family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney),\"\"View From The Top\"\",03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as Julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad film, but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about, unless you like a film location in Canada and a good looking Catherine Mary Stewart, a native from Canada.\",neg\\r\\n\"We just saw this film previewed before release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: There were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What\\'s sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too \"\"heavy\"\" for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn\\'t be caught dead walking into the theater showing it. Too bad. A good film wasted.\",pos\\r\\nThe Animatrix: A Detective Story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity in this animated cartoon. I really like the \\'Private Detective\\' ideas created by the Director.,pos\\r\\n\"I was Stan in the movie \"\"Dreams Come True\"\". Stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming (where was the ambulance?) The acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. It played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen. I may be bias, but overall, I enjoyed it. Also the soundtrack was the band Spooner, who later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played Swenson the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk with the police.\",neg\\r\\n\"too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... this was filmed in New Zealand ...This Martha Moxley case had been \\'cold\\' for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep it alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided he did not want to be remembered only for his involvement in the Nicole Simpson case .... which could have been deleterious to his reputation (if it already hadn\\'t)... Anyway, he followed along as the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships Martha formed .... Unattended boys coming of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always looped ...Plus the fact that they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star... she was a cute sweet girl next door type. Other than that, the other characters were really great, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played as Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were good as well, the costumers had to keep it all in the 70s look and back up to the 90s ....It kept my interest even when I caught on about the Skakel guy ....\",pos\\r\\n\"The story of pre-unified China must be a popular one. Jet Li\\'s Hero made the assassination of the King popular.This is another story made a few years earlier. It stars the incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) as the King\\'s lover, who was sent to recruit an assassin so that the King could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls in love with him.No matter, he is not able to complete the mission anyway, as the King knew about him beforehand. I suspected he also knew, but went anyway.It was a beautiful story with massive military operations, and, of course, another chance to see Li Gong.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is primarily about love in WWII, yet we must remember that it\\'s also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.The movie\\'s timing is just great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you\\'re not going to get bombed. While it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.At one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. Cillian Murphy is on fine form here, as is Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch. The relationship formed between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley\\'s characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank (and watch out for a cameo by Suggs of \\'Madness\\'). Despite all of this, it\\'s a rather slow movie. Coupled with the fact it\\'s just shy of two hours, it\\'s quite a slog to get to the conclusion.Overall, it\\'s a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known British names behind the scenes. But it really does drone on for too much at times. Still, a worthwhile watch. 7/10\",pos\\r\\n\"And now for another point of view: I didn\\'t like it. I didn\\'t finish it in fact. I know that \"\"Unforgiven\"\" is ranked by some as one of the greatest Westerns ever made. I know that it stars and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know that it won a bunch of Oscars. Still, I didn\\'t like it. I don\\'t like Westerns, and that\\'s clearly a matter of taste, but I also don\\'t admire Eastwood\\'s acting. He is not and never has been a leading man. He is no Burt Lancaster, no Paul Newman, no John Wayne. In this film alone he is dwarfed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired tough guy. When I see him on screen, I see a man laboring at his acting. Then there\\'s the anti-Western Western plot. It is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women, blacks, native Americans, and single parents; a disrespect for violence and drinking; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage, and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren\\'t necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting those values, the movie comes across as mannered, if not preachy. Then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold, the kid who can\\'t shoot straight, the city slicker new to the wild West, the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords. Finally there is the pacing of Eastwood\\'s direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still riding north, chatting with Morgan Freeman and the kid who couldn\\'t shoot straight, sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion. It was way too slow. Somebody had to find these elements uncompelling. I am afraid it was me.\",neg\\r\\n\"Yes,the movie is not a piece of art but the first time I watched it I was 10 years old,my parents were out and I stayed home with my two brothers.It was May 1970(I know that because I found a note about the cycle of horror movies that one network had).It\\'s one of the most vivid memories I have with the guys.We ended all in one bed and covered up to the head! Our very first horror movie! We kept talking about it for years and laughing about the moment.Those were horror movies.Nowadays horror movies are always the same.Or was it better when we were kids enjoying without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogs? Most sure it was that.But for me this is a great movie!\",neg\\r\\n\"Attention, possible spoilersThis film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny. The director has put in all the clich\\xc3\\xa9s that have ever plagued B-series movies. The stupid bimbo (nice rack) getting caught again and again by the bad guys, chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who, of course, bullied/killed the hero\\'s father in an unclear past, a side-kick in the person of a policeman - small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another clich\\xc3\\xa9) is returning his baseball-cap rim-backwards etc. The film\\'s end really tops it. After the chief villain dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high, they walk out of the building. Which, from the exteriors, looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall. When they exit the building, the side-kick can\\'t walk, being that his right leg appears to be wounded. How, nobody can tell: ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as \"\"Where is the villain\\'s body which should lay near the building?\"\" and \"\"Why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body?\"\". I could go on forever with the list. Why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time? Why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking? Why does the hero look so faggy? Is there anyone really thinking \"\"yes, these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember\"\"? And the actors suck. Our hero and saviour of the day wears the same expression on his face. The whole film. That disgusted-trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of him.Also, thinking that until now 12% of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside. They might have been serious and then we\\'re doomed.\",neg\\r\\n\"What we have here the standard Disney direct to DVD sequel, where I would expect cots are cut in all areas resulting in an okay animated movie that falls well short of the original. That is not to say that this is a terrible movie it is just that it is a very mediocre movie full of the preachy messages intended to show children the virtues of friendship and being nice to one another and unless done subtly (which it is not here) can quickly become grating for adults. The film has a very thin plot line with Kronk trying to win the approval of his father, and ending up finding the true meaning of wealth and success. This has it\\'s comedy moments but is really nor enough to carry a full length film.\",neg\\r\\n\"A group of people goes deep into the jungle for various reasons, and finally find a lost city (where apparently King Solomon\\'s Diamonds are) and a race of super-gorilla\\'s... Now, you know you\\'re in trouble when you put fine actors like Linney and Curry in one movie that stars... a talking gorilla, and that is just the beginning. Okay, what else...?For an action/adventure movie the film is... well, lacking just that. The first hour (!) of the movie they aren\\'t even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with subplot after subplot (something about a local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do... it\\'s just no fun anymore.The effects of the movie are only so-and-so (and really bad compared to the earlier Jurassic Park movie).Now, the ending... The father not caring for the death of his son, but just interested in the diamonds? Uh-huh... only in the movies folks, only in the movies.A complete waste of talent, this Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER) adaptation. 2/10.\",neg\\r\\n\"There were but two reasons for me to see this film. First of all Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei were in it (who are both good actors) and I had nothing better to do. While seeing the film though, I immediately thought of something better to do: SLEEP! This film is a complete waste of time. It is a standard ex-cop flick. The ex-copper is the best there ever was, but he was fired. He keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day. All BIG surprises (NOT!!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one.4 out of 10\",neg\\r\\n\"I enjoyed this movie extremely. It was the last great Mario Van Peebles movie I know of. It had a hip-hop old west flavor to it. Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc had major parts. It shouldn\\'t have won any Oscars, but it was enjoyable all the same.\",pos\\r\\n\"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin\\'s birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of \"\"The Origin of Species\"\", so it\\'s fitting that Jon Amiel\\'s \"\"Creation\"\" got released. The movie focuses on the period of Darwin\\'s (Paul Bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.I guess that the movie overplayed Darwin\\'s tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter Annie, but I still like the thought of Darwin\\'s theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma. As it was, the US was one of the last countries in which \"\"Creation\"\" found a distributor, due to the creationism-evolution debate (yes, it\\'s still going on).All in all, this isn\\'t a masterpiece, but I recommend it the same way that I recommend \"\"Inherit the Wind\"\". I hope that one day, the creationism-evolution debate won\\'t be an issue. If this film helps put the debate to rest, then more power to everyone in the movie! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'ve expected a comedy about the NVA, but this is a parody. It shows the national army of Eastern Germany in a light that is not appropriate, and definitely not true.One can make a comedy about everything, as long as the underlying facts are not changed. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni with \"\"LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL\"\" has shown.The movie NVA would be an \"\"OK\"\" comedy, because the jokes in it are overall OK. Nothing special - not hilarious, but enough to live with it.The point is, that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the NVA. A death machine that was ready to attack WESTERN EUROPE along with it\\'s friend the RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the utmost from it\\'s soldiers. An army that marched into the CSPR in 1968, and was ready to march also in POLAND to destroy the SOLIDARNOSC. You can\\'t make a movie without showing the tiniest bit of evil, or would you make a parody about a KZ,Guantanamo or 9/11??? Showing Osama bin Laden as a funny screwed guy? 90 minutes about a funny Osama in a Afghan Taliban camp, where he makes jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the NVA!\",neg\\r\\n\"One of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen!!! Absolutely awful. Poor acting, poor story, there isn\\'t one redeeming quality about this movie to recommend. Amistad is much better. Avoid this movie like the plague!\",neg\\r\\n\"I saw this on television more years ago than I can remember, but never forgot the performance of Sammy Davis, Jr. I just by chance thought to look for it on video. This rendition of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well. I just can\\'t imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances Sammy Davis, Jr. every gave. Whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his/her ignorance. I will continue to look for it though. Maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many African American actors.\",pos\\r\\n\"First off, I just watched a movie on SHOWTIME called Survival Island. It says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane and since I like him and couldn\\'t sleep I thought I would check it out. Looked interesting. Watched it, and decided to look up on the IMDb who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG I could not believe it, this movie has been renamed THREE and will be a new movie?? It is playing again in 1 hr and 30 mins on Showtime Channel again and this date is May 28 and EDT or Florida time. You can check your showtime listings by title and see it. I wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off, you see her naked body.... when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on. Funny, there are a lot of other mess ups too. I can\\'t believe by coincidence I decided to look up this movie... Go figure! Wonder if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on Showtime, ha ha. Good laugh. I give it 1-1/2 stars. C-, D+ movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie is a real shame, not just for the plot,the empty performance of the characters, it is for the lack of creativity from the director and all the crew, this is maybe one of the worst movies of all times,and it is hard to believe that is the sequel of one of the most famous movies of the 90\\'s.I am a great fan of The Mask, when I went to see this movie I was expecting to a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with a acceptable plot, instead I saw a really bad copy of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery cartoons, the movie was not funny even for my 7 years old sister, so I wonder:What was wrong New Line Cinema???.Was it trying to repeat the success of the first movie, or was it trying to create another masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings???.Because if they did, they were completely out of their minds.\",neg\\r\\n\"I admit I have been a fan of Harrison Ford for many, many years now so it didn\\'t surprise me that I enjoyed his performance here. But I also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done. I don\\'t know whether I \"\"buy into\"\" Kristin Scott Thomas as a Congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. I took notice of her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.Here her and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash. They are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. Apparently Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C., discovers that his wife was having an affair. He further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a New England Congresswoman.The story takes on many subplots as Ford and Thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, the uncovering of deceipt, and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.I think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable.\",pos\\r\\n\"A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock \\xc2\\x96 though as foul-mouthed as usual \\xc2\\x96 is fairly subdued as Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only occasionally surfaces and always when it is needed most.There are some interesting allusions: the first time you see Betty she is dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale from the `Wizard of Oz\\' \\xc2\\x96 then later in the film she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never been out of Kansas before. At one point the song that Doris Day was best known for, \\xc2\\x91Que Sera Sera\\' is on the soundtrack and then later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes her as having \\xc2\\x91a whole Doris Day thing going on.\\'This is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting cast.It has a surprising ending that, as contrary as it sounds, is actually fairly predictable.If for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.\",pos\\r\\n\"I think this movie was made as good as it could have been. With only 4 months and a 52000$ budget - I\\'m surprised this wasn\\'t worse. If you are not to care about the CG or special effects, this movie is great.Okay, the movie is not that well made (I\\'m sure it could have been but, you try to do better in only 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting.DOn\\'t trust me when I say that this movie is good, cause I also find the 1933 King Kong to be good.I must confess that I didn\\'t watch the complete movie either... I might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there...\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is one of the best and moving I have ever seen, because of the terrible good performance of the main actress Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who really makes you feel with her. Also the music by Mark Snow is wonderful.\",pos\\r\\n\"I fail to see how anyone who has actually read the M. Didius Falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them. An Aussie has no business in Ancient Rome. Nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits.\",neg\\r\\n\"A professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried. The quality cast, stark setting and excellent cinemetography made you hope for Fargo or High Plains Drifter but sorry, the soup had no seasoning...or meat for that matter. A 3 (of 10) for effort.\",neg\\r\\n\"With No Dead Heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his buddy Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene hilt by Nick Nicholson who might I add not only doesn\\'t attempt once to speak with a Russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialog coach for this film. Soon William is re-recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan\\'s El Salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it\\'s a wonder why this film doesn\\'t have more of a cult following. One such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I\\'ve ever heard. Who would strip completely nude in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the end theme from Blood on Satan\\'s Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. In one scene Harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find film that has recently gotten the full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues.\",neg\\r\\n\"I first saw this film when released in 1980. From other sources, I\\'ve learnt that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in New York City, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So, I guess I saw the shorter version first which, at the time, I thought, was a very interesting anti-Western, if a trifle confusing...So, it was with even more interest that I finally obtained a DVD of the full-length version. I\\'m glad I did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic, and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unwarranted, to say the very least.Yes, it\\'s a long movie, but so have been many others. For example: Once upon a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus {restored version} (1960) at 198 minutes; Gone with the Wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. So, it can\\'t be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back, when Heaven\\'s Gate came on the scene.But note this: all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes.Not so Heaven\\'s Gate: in this narrative, the American West is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness, injustice, and poverty. And that\\'s probably the first reason why so many disliked this film: it laid out the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming, showing how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of cattle rustling; and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities, right up to the President of the United States. For an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link at Wikipedia under Johnson County War.Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country\\'s history, and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. Had it been a documentary, it would have been barely palatable for most; as entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous.Leaving aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment, that Cimino launched herein, what about the narrative \\xc2\\x96 the story of the three main characters? Well, it probably wasn\\'t unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it\\'s probably not unusual now. It\\'s a fairly standard love triangle whereby Ella must choose between the two men, and ultimately decides upon the younger man, Nathan, who, although not above resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the older James (or Jim, as most people in the film say). For some, that part of the story threads too slowly, perhaps; in the context of the wider narrative about the war, however, it is, I think, entirely appropriate.And that war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly \\xc2\\x96 although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I\\'m certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. A minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219-minute cut was restored? Any way you look at it, though, it hits you in the face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war...Which brings me to another criticism by others: the noise and dust is such that it\\'s often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening. I\\'ll admit that I found that to be a trifle annoying at first, even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words \\xc2\\x96 until I realized that really wasn\\'t necessary if you accept the director\\'s intent: life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and, in war, it\\'s the sine qua non of this mise-en-scene. In short, it\\'s as though you truly are present in and within the scenes...And what of the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to a figurative nearness to God and so, if you equate God with the natural world, the stunning scenery that pervades the movie \\xc2\\x96 and it is stunning, hauntingly equal to that of David Lean\\'s Doctor Zhivago (1965) \\xc2\\x96 is a useful metaphor. I tend to think, however, that Cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants \\xc2\\x96 the God-fearing salt of the earth \\xc2\\x96 were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom\\'s champion.Was that Cimino\\'s intent \\xc2\\x96 to gut the myth of the American West? To show how, in America, only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred, one way or another, throughout history? Is that anything new? Not really, as we all know. Where it really hurt, however, is in showing how America was not and, by implication, is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after absorbing this narrative, we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of America have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves...\",pos\\r\\n\"Born in 1946 I was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression.Not only scary ,for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years.The mob goon played by John Larch was terrifying.The only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a \"\"little n----- kid\"\".Those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on TV,maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene.Accurate or not the film went a long way in formulating my opinion of the South and still till today the closest I\\'ve come to visiting a southern city is El Paso.That stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story.When the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years.With the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact.The film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility.The terror in the movie isn\\'t provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time.Re killing of little girl:The recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mind.When this movie came out the only school I had ever gone to was attended by mostly African-Americans.The victim looked like a girl in my class,it was like seeing an actual killing.It made a horrible scene that much worse.Maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me.\",pos\\r\\n\"I caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television. I expected to only tune in for a few minutes, but found myself intrigued by the movie. I ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling. The acting by the three American leads was quite good, especially that of Alex Cord. He plays a gunslinger with quite a degree of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. He ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. The final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet out of Clay McCord. Somewhat gruesome, but realistic. I must admit that, despite my initial misgivings at watching a \"\"spaghetti western\"\", I ended up enjoying this film quite a bit. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.\",pos\\r\\n\"It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. Just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater. I\\'m not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in New York this past April, but I sincerely hope not many. It sounds like a light and playful pinku flick, but it has art-house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring. Many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but this film\\'s aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating. And then the sex scenes aren\\'t even good! I\\'ve seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty Japanese movies. I\\'ve never seen this country produce something with sex this dull. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress, Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, this is pure torture.\",neg\\r\\n\"Excellent cast, story line, performances. Totally believable. I realize the close knit group that exemplifies the Marine Corps. But this movie brought fear to my heart. The marines let principles be damned. It seems that this film was based on real life incidents. It shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment. Anne Heche was utterly convincing. Sam Shepard\\'s portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering. And Eric Stoltz as her attorney was so deft balancing his loyalty to the Corp but also his loyalty to his client, while high above on his tightrope. He knew what his true course of action had to be. But he was pulled apart by his immersion in the Marine tradition, loyalty to the Corps above all else. I sat riveted to the TV screen. All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don\\'t see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven\\'t even read the book, and guess what? I don\\'t care. In fact, if the movie and book are so different, then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it.I thought the acting was bloody brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen, so evil, and so cold - you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a love-struck girl who is determined to find her love no matter what it takes, and goes on a wonderful adventure. And I just love all of the Snow Queen\\'s sisters (the Spring Witch, the Summer Princess, and Autumn Robber)they are so fun and different in many ways.I haven\\'t seen this movie in awhile, so forgive me if I make a minor mistake.... but there\\'s no doubt that I will always love this movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"If you watch this movie you\\'ll be quoting it and referring to it for a long time to come. It\\'s been years since I saw Dolemite and I still quote it to this day. It\\'s a true classic. It is so mind-numbingly awful that it makes a hilarious view. Every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing. Every wobbly shot a work of art(?). And every punch and kick so woefully executed. You won\\'t believe your eyes. It\\'s all I can say. If I really get into how mesmerizing this movie is I won\\'t be able to stop and I\\'ll go way over the IMDb 1000-word limit.Please, please watch this movie. You\\'ll be in hysterics. Either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn\\'t really know to interest enough and doesn\\'t appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer\\'s plot to kill his uncle. It\\'s quite simple and doesn\\'t seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn\\'t really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself. It makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times, also mostly since it doesn\\'t correspond with most other Columbo movies.The characters are good and it helps that it features Martin Landau in a double role. It\\'s always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man, while for instance a person such as Peter Falk hardly changed any over the years, he only got grayer. The movie also features Julie Newmar among others, who is best know for playing Catwoman in the \\'60\\'s \"\"Batman\"\" life action series. It\\'s funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie. Intentional or is this just her way of acting?It\\'s an enjoyable and good to watch Columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script.7/10\",pos\\r\\n\"Frank Tashlin\\'s \\'Censored\\' is a so-so Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he\\'s to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy, First Class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu\\'s extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic I\\'ve come across in any of these shorts thus far. Despite all this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. For great examples of this, seek out Tashlin\\'s \\'The Goldbrick\\' or Chuck Jones\\'s \\'Spies\\'. \\'Censored\\' is fairly weak by comparison.\",neg\\r\\n\"I had to read I Know Why The Caged Birds Sing in my English class and we watched the movie after finishing it. After watching the movie, I regret seeing. It completely took away any of the impact the book had. The scenes made no sense in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed as though the screen writer never actually picked up the book but opted for the cliff notes instead. I was outraged at how the movie ended. Almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to Maya\\'s growth as a person. If you have read ...Caged Birds, this movie will ruin the experience of the book so I warn you not to see it.\",neg\\r\\n\"Kar Wai Wong\\'s incredibly impressive romance that is to me, perfect. Set in 1960\\'s Hong Kong. As we are shown, this is set in a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who meet each other in a Hong Kong apartment, in which they both move in. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after they both find out their spouses, constantly away are committing extra-marital trysts. With each other.The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are nothing short of amazing. Both Leung and Cheung manage to strike such amazing chemistry with one another, it\\'s better than any Hollywood romance that is put out today. Combined. The film is all about the focus of the two leads and their feelings after the infidelities of their partners. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such strong character development between these two characters, you really start to feel for them. Leung and Cheung are both wildly amazing, are better than any Hollywood pairing shown on the screen today. Combined.There\\'s nothing much else to describe Fa yeung nin wa other than beautiful, energetic romance that also features a moody, atmospheric piece with gorgeous cinematography. So much elements of this movie help create it to be flawless. As well as Kar Wai Wong and the acting, the cinematography from both Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is haunting. Beautifully understated. The shots from Kar Wai Wong help makes your mind create a world of it\\'s own. A world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This film is incredibly unforgettable.The costumes created by Kar Wai Wong regular William Chang are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, who wears an elegant, ankle-deep, beautifully patterned dress in every scene. She\\'s a scene-stealer. Her costumes say a lot about her character and an emotion is fitted in all of her dresses colours which are vividly and smartly used. Highly original. Chang, also the production designer creates a brilliant setting for the movies moody piece. Especially with the help of the marvellous music used in scenes and masterful film editing, again by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unsung hero for this movie.Overall, this movie is one of the best from this millennium. Incredibly compelling and filled with nostalgia. The shots are mesmerising and haunting. Kar Wai Wong somewhat proves to be a master at the top of his game. The acting; music; cinematography; editing; production; costume and direction all help create ONE small, little perfect film. A masterpiece in romance film-making. Visually spectacular. Overall, a masterpiece to film-making. A film that reminds me of old classic Hollywood, was the one that never was. Never forget Fa yeung nin wa. I know I won\\'t.\",pos\\r\\n\"Well, I read the other comments. Didn\\'t think it sounded any good, but decided to tape it anyway. Perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie, because of course I would be noticing all the same weird things. Excessive use of fade to black, a few weird camera angles and crosscutting dialog for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times! But noticing all that I thought to myself: Well, this would probably be really boring if it was all going chronologically. The conversations aren\\'t that exciting, but kind of mandatory. And the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast forwarding too the interesting part. Skipping the boring bits. At the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting too. Will they survive? So I actually liked this movie? No, not really. The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from being bored while he is trying to introduce the characters. But he is overdoing it. It gets annoying, and sometimes confusing. This was apparently only the second movie he directed, so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future. And if you\\'re sitting there (in the future) reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch. Well, if he is good in the future, sure, watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one. Otherwise this movie isn\\'t really worth watching unless you very interested in film-making, and want to see one way you can cut the mandatory boring introductory scenes into something watchable.\",neg\\r\\n\"Until today, I thought there only three people, including me, who considered Heaven\\'s Gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven\\'s Gate. Through it\\'s production and release it was vilified, as no movie since Cleopatra, almost twenty years before. At one time it was considered the most expensive over-budget movie of all time, surpassing even Cleopatra. It was blamed for the downfall of its studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling. Michael Cimino, fresh from his glory with the Deer Hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess, but clearly, that was petty jealousy at its worst. Cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the American experience. This film is not to be missed but any serious student of American filmmaking.\",pos\\r\\n\"Heya Denver fans! The animation is a cartoon\\'s classic & one of my favorite too (and yes, it was broadcast in Europe as well.

More imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morals, more substance, great storyline and excellent character voices. Computer animated shows of today lack all of these features.

Overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. After a while, i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn\\'t such a stuffed-up anal retentive.And, this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn\\'t have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out, blue-steel-greyishness. Hmmm, the last time i checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors. In fact, the light they put out tends to be more in the warmish, yellowish-orange range of the spectrum. So where\\'s all the blue-steel-grey light coming from?This movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx, but it\\'s still dreck. It\\'s pathetic junk put out for today\\'s movie-goers who are easily placated by pathetic junk.I very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices, but this was a total hack job.Universal Studios\\' 1941 \"\"The Wolfman\"\" is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays.I\\'m done with this franchise. The first movie was reasonably decent. The second still somewhat entertaining. But this one i couldn\\'t even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring.\",neg\\r\\n\"This piece of crap doesn\\'t worth a critical review so I\\'ll write some information for those who don\\'t know the background of this movie. First off all it is not the first Saudi movie, they used this wrong info for commercial purpose (they lied!). Second they made it for money not for anything else so they picked the jerk (Hesham) who won Star Academy (like Big Brother) it is a popular show and the jerk Hesham is popular but dumb, cheesy & untalented then picked the famous Kuwaiti actor Mohammed Al Sairafi (also dumb & untalented) but has a popular (count how many times I\\'ll use the word \"\"popular\"\" then email me to get your prize, however..) has popular show and the Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan who appeared in POPular comic show CBM (unfunny) so she is famous * PoPular! Then they picked some Saudi actors for .. blah blah blah. The funniest thing is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I believe that the identity of the movie is the identity of its director) .. wait a minute! The screen play was written by an Egyptian screenwriter (very awful one!) with some help from Lebanese critic (famous as critic but actually he is a money collector!). This group of the multi races (money slaves) doesn\\'t know anything about the Saudi culture they don\\'t represent it but when we know who is behind this garbage all our questions will be relieved! Waleed bin Talaal is Saudi prince and (B U S I N E S S M A N) who doesn\\'t care about the Saudi culture or Saudi people he even doesn\\'t live in Saudi Arabia (even if he lives he will live in his own world, his world is far far far away from the real world the people world) so he doesn\\'t know anything or care about anything except raising his endless fortune.*Not Saudi movie(not anything movie).Screw them all.Beep out of 10!\",neg\\r\\n\"Upon writing this review I have difficulty trying to think of what to write about. Nothing much happens in this film. The storyline is a South Asian woman who falls for an English Londoner. The problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak. At the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother, and it just escalates from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. As soon as all this stuff has happened it\\'s all pretty much standard. It drags slightly even though it\\'s only about 90 minutes long. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you\\'re male I do not recommend this film to you.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie was so awful i don\\'t even know where to begin...The only positive thing i can say about it is that Luke Perry gave a good performance. The entire movie was all over the place, there was no explanation as to the cause(only theories)of the eruptions, or rationals for their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy, you just wanna laugh!! There was just no background to any of them. The \"\"love\"\" relationship seemed to have been added on to the script, it was so awkward. There\\'s an army man; big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with the \"\"AaarrrGH!i\\'m the Man!\"\" attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. The two sidekicks, who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys. And then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebody\\'s shoulder and for the rest of the movie he\\'s coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or something...and then plays hero (cheesiest scene of all!!) to help the plan which is to do who knows what... its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of THE dramatic scene...in a nutshell; don\\'t waste your time!\",neg\\r\\n\"Valentine \"\"Dogkiller\"\" Dussaut and Joe \"\"The Judge\"\" Kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of Geneva!

Don\\'t be fooled by the deceptive Miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious, art house flick. This movie is 100% action!\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this film on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture \"\"...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life.\"\" Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich \"\"gentlemen\"\", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon.And the story is inspirational. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of \"\"Holes\"\") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.And, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of \"\"Miracle\"\" and \"\"Remember the Titans.\"\"FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.\",pos\\r\\n\"I am a Christian, and thought this movie was pretty good! :) While the acting wasn\\'t Academy Award caliber, I thought it was good, considering the cast has had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made.The Gospel message and the transforming power of Jesus Christ was explained wonderfully. The message that the director was trying to get across (which is THE important thing, not how the characters dressed!) definitely got through. The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was a good idea, too (cool muscle cars, btw). I think this movie will definitely reach out to a lot of young people.I would definitely recommend this movie, it is a great witnessing tool! :)\",pos\\r\\n\"With looks that could kill, and a willingness to display her charms, Paget\\'s sensuality leaves no doubt as to where her assets lay...

Her luscious legs make her hard to forget!The emphasis is not on the plot, but on the visual pleasure of a great number of beautiful girls in sensual Technicolored costumes...\",pos\\r\\n\"The title of this documentary is very misleading. At no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the Nile Perch fish into Lake Victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of Mwanza, Tanzania. The film tries to place the problems of Tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force. The documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever. Instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter. There are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the Nile Perch fish. One is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile Perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. The film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. The second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the Nile Perch has introduced, and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become. The subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the Perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most African countries. The film tries to link the introduction of the Perch fish with AIDS, Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania but never makes a direct connection. As any intelligent person well read with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with the fish. It would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don\\'t. The fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. Yes things are BAD within the town of Mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.A weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First off Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small portion of the country. Many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to Mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. This documentary is very weak, has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the Nile Perch. It plays on people\\'s emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty, famine and AIDS making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to the Perch Fish. The fact is most of the problems have more to do with War, Globalization and Christianity than and environmental effect of the Perch fish itself.\",neg\\r\\n\"I saw \"\"The Reader\"\" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat. Haven\\'t we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format, or stage stories that weren\\'t properly adapted to screen? I applaud \"\"The Reader\"\" for really doing it right, and I encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously. Worth every moment!\",pos\\r\\n\"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but \"\"The Muppet Movie\"\" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features \"\"The Great Muppet Caper\"\" and \"\"The Muppets Take Manhattan\"\". It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn\\'t get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson\\'s premature death in 1990. I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack. Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn\\'t exactly been disappointing.One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing \"\"Rainbow Connection\"\", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west. He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit\\'s love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain\\'s mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated \"\"Rainbow Connection\"\" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie\\'s catchy road song, \"\"Movin\\' Right Along\"\", and \"\"I\\'m Going to Go Back There Someday\"\", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo. \"\"Never Before, Never Again\"\", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden. The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you\\'re familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the \"\"Insolent Waiter.\"\" Also, it\\'s not 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing \"\"Muppets from Space\"\" (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson\\'s death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it\\'s a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it! However, I can\\'t say I think the same of any of that movie\\'s predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier. \"\"The Muppet Movie\"\" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that\\'s understandable. I highly doubt there\\'s much left to say about \"\"The Muppet Movie\"\" that hasn\\'t been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry, but I cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought \"\"Ethan Mao\"\" was. I have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! WARNING: I am going to give away a key element to the \"\"plot\"\". After holding his family hostage overnight, Ethan lets his vile, evil, hated step-mom go to the bank - ALONE!!! - to retrieve the piece of his late mom\\'s jewellery which he so desperately wants. Guess what? She calls the cops! Wow ... what a twist! I couldn\\'t see that coming at all.The only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes.Pure, unadulterated rubbish!\",neg\\r\\n\"For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing. All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can\\'t stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). Dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) don\\'t compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work. Movies aren\\'t supposed to transfer a book to the screen, but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it. When people say \"\"the book was so much better\"\" (they\\'re usually wrong anyway) what they are really trying to say is the book was so different.\",pos\\r\\n\"Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today. Many consider just two out of the year\\'s best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. And in \\'Everything is Illuminated,\\' the mark is hit directly.The film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. From the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. And also, the cast is introduced perfectly. For Elijah Wood\\'s character, Jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother\\'s hand. And for the character entitled Alex, it is easy to see his life in his perspective - the true Ukrainian rock star. With the cast illuminated at first, the story slowly eases into our minds as Jonathon decides to venture to Ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather, thus the entire family. And from there, the story movies slowly, yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear-dripping drama and laugh-out-loud humor included in scene-by-scene, every scene.Although the movie itself is rather awarding, there are several complaints from other sources commenting about Liev Schrieber\\'s inaccurate adaptation of the Jonathon Safron Foer novel. Personally, I have never read the novel. But any movie, especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book, but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. Just because it may be far-fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must-see - it still is.Throughout the film, new information inundates the audience\\'s mind very slowly. Some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the second half of the movie refocuses its entire topic and reason of travel through Ukraine onto something different, yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film. The film does however leave you on a satisfied note - yet to the weak-hearted souls, a tear may be dropped. And throughout the film. to the saneful people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from Alex and John\\'s fun and ongoing conversations.I would recommend this film to several different types of people: to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama-comedy, for those who have an interest in family connections, and to those whom have an interest in Holocaustic subjects. And to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. And for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film, you are wrong; this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences. And to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this film, but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book.All in all, \\'Everything is Illuminated\\' is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones\\' hearts.\",pos\\r\\n\"Interesting concept that just doesn\\'t make it. I watched the whole movie, but had to read IMDb comments to find out what Code 46 meant. If/when it was explained in the film, I must have been in a coma, or possibly brain-dead by then. I only watched it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip-off. We all have to start somewhere, but this film should not be it. As to the \\'anti empathy virus virus\\'-Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where were The Joker, The Riddler, etc? Also, why are the women all so damned ugly? If I want to see less-than-plain stick-figures, I\\'ll just walk down the street. The best part of the film was the car crash. It was totally believable, and not over-the-top like most movie crashes.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie should be retitled: Sex in the 70s In a Part of New York City called Greenwich Village and Chelsea.This movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the hypersexual environments of public and private sex spaces in New York City. I doubt that the Manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film.Don\\'t get me wrong, the time period looks like a blast. And it\\'s rather important to document the scene to which the film refers. But as far as calling this film Sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. Technically it\\'s no Oscar Nominee, but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject.Overall, an \"\"eh.\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"It\\'s funny... one day before i have seen this movie i had been watching a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so comparison kind of came automatically... of course there isn\\'t any :) This movie is weak in every aspect... acting is not convincing (especially the one who plays Simona...) and unnatural..., editing in confused and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot, music doesn\\'t fit, the story doesn\\'t flow, it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is... oh, and the characters aren\\'t very well shown, you actually can\\'t tell much about the girls (except what you see)... The movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing (which is very laughable :)So... 2/10\",neg\\r\\n\"For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don\\'t know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.\",pos\\r\\n\"I remember the trailer for this infamously weak spin-off of Conan. I saw the movie years later and laughed my head off. Unintentionally! Poor Briggite Nielson. Her career never had a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the movie is this: Sonja(Brigitte Nielson) hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen Gedren(Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by. Sonja goes on a hunt for Queen Gedren and later finds out that Gedren killed her parents. On her quest she reluctantly joins Kalidor(Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn(Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his bumbling idiotic servant, Falkon(Paul L. Smith). Together they go on a hunt for Queen Gedren and the orb. The acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. I mean Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades, Sonja doesn\\'t look fazed at all. Arnold is playing his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr.... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! The moronic manservant Falkon had more personality than these guys. The action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat. The scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my ribs ached. The dialog is a hoot also. Its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with. I can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy. Anyone else don\\'t bother.\",neg\\r\\n\"Am I the only person who believes this American version is far better than the 1934 English film? The English version has no suspense, looks antique and very low budget, and has unexceptional acting (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, besides having top production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect \\'innocent\\' American abroad, and gives Doris Day her best role ever. Of particular note is the music - the music of the American film is almost classic; compare the \"\"Albert Hall\\' sequences of both, and you will agree that the Bernard Herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version (even though it\\'s basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a hard show to watch. It\\'s not something to sit back and relax to. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People get screwed over, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there is excrement, puke and blood. Oz is a brave show. It brings up issues like racism, homosexuality, prisoners reality and most of all; -capital punishment. It is, in my opinion also successful in doing so, unlike for example, the single-tracked \"\"Medium\"\".It bored me sometimes. It had some weird story lines and they spent to much time on characters that just didn\\'t interest me. Strangely enough, I found season 1 to be quite boring. If I had watched it while it aired I think I wouldn\\'t have continued to watch it. I love seasons 2 - 4. Season 5 and 6 are watchable, (although I think it shouldn\\'t be allowed to utter the words \"\"Cyril\"\" and \"\"Death Row\"\" in the same sentence)There are so many marvelous characters to root for. The old guys Bob and Busmalis, who I absolutely fell in love with from day one. Said, Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, who\\'s monologues tied the episodes together so efficient. The staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada-also brilliant. Also minor characters that was only in for a couple of episodes or a few seasons, but left a good impression as well.My favorites are the O\\'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most gut-wrenching and warmest I seen on television. If there is anything I will always remember about this show it\\'s them. There will never be another \"\"pairing\"\" or what to call it, that will make me ache so much. Thats why, when the ends come for them as well, it almost hurt to much. I wish it would never have happened. I wish I had never watched it.But good one Fontana. I do recommend it.\",pos\\r\\n\"At last. Here\\'s a movie that does as much for the reputations of the men of Greece and Russia as \"\"Gigli\"\" did for the those of Mr. Affleck and Ms. Lo. FROM THE EDGE OF THE CITY details the sad and sordid lives of some young Russian \\xc3\\xa9migr\\xc3\\xa9s who live in and around Athens and spend their time burglarizing cars, getting laid, pimping woman \\xc3\\xa9migr\\xc3\\xa9s and prostituting themselves (\"\"But we\\'re not gay because we don\\'t do, you know.... And if we do, it\\'s only once or twice. With the same guy.\"\") There is hardly anything here you have not seen before and better; only the Athens locale adds a little novelty--even then there\\'s but a scene or two that\\'s scenic. Writer/director Constantine Giannaris (\"\"3 Steps to Heaven\"\") offer a relatively generic 95 minutes, in which the standout moments involve how stupid, sexist and (from the looks of things) pretty much irredeemable most of these guys are. (Interestingly, the gayer the guy, the more redeemable he appears.) What really rankles is the treatment of the women. Greek and Russian males would seem to give the Italians a run for their money regarding that famous madonna/whore complex. Has life in Greece improved much for women since the time of Plato and Socrates? One has to wonder.If I seem to be equating Russians and Greeks in this review, I apologize, but even the non-\\xc3\\xa9migr\\xc3\\xa9s pictured here (the cab driver, for instance) are creeps. According to another review on this site, the film (a hit on its home turf) was actually submitted by Greece for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. What this says about the state of Greek movie-making, I hesitate to ponder.\",neg\\r\\n\"**********SPOILER ALERT***************If you happen to like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2, or 3:If you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality (case in point-John Carpenter\\'s DARK STAR-highly recommended)If you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general-THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS CINEMATIC CRAPSTERPIECE!The shameless use of stock footage from CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino/slasher flick- Take the scene, for instance, where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. Why is that? Simply because this scene was lifted directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a crummy flick to begin with.The ending was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight-to-video loser. Again, we see Mr. Rex do battle against a bulldozer-which alternates as a forklift truck-through the miracle of -ta-daa!- stock footage from the aforementioned CARNOSAUR 1 & 2. Of course, the ending is exactly the same-the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames.A real insult to anyone\\'s intelligence.But it\\'s still better than watching the ROSIE O\\' DONNEL SHOW.Rating: 1/2* out of *****\",neg\\r\\n\"if i had watched this movie when i hit rock bottom i probably would have sunk into the deepest depression of my life, and may have been nearly desperate enough to try it, the only thing is in the real world, when you rob millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals, everything doesn\\'t come up roses (unless you are an investment banker or government affiliated) so how does that matter? i had been rejected from school after school, and it stings, so it is a brilliant topic for a movie, and when you give yourself over to the imaginary to let yourself watch this movie without applying real world ramifications, it can truly touch someone in that situation, and let them know they are not alone. overdone soliloquy completely tears apart the established educational system as we know it. really, all i can say is that as i am in college now, looking back on where i was, and watching this movie, i can truly appreciate it in a way i never would have been able to otherwise. it is juvenile and contrite yes, but it is an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom, and i cant think of a better way to end my night.\",pos\\r\\n\"The way i found out about this movie was when i watched American pie 2, at the start it had a trailer for Ali G indahouse, i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the DVD, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day, i went to my local store and picked it up for \\xc2\\xa33.99 (Bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is a \"\"gangster\"\" of the west staines massive crew, who\\'s rivals are the east staines massive crew. Ali has a \"\"Cub Scout\"\" pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the \"\"ghetto\"\" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars, after Ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where Ali teaches the kids, he runs for MP for staines and overthrows another MP in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in staines.

Nothing can beatthat. -Joefro\",pos\\r\\n\"The film is somewhat entertaining, but the greatest feature is Shalom Harlow\\'s laughable performance. It has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully Harlow has gone through more training. Perhaps she should stick to the more worldly, somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances.\",neg\\r\\n\"If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice which matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 on, his \"\"silent\"\" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet Lloyd\\'s sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the Glass character\\'s enemy was not sound but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd\\'s perception as an insincere glad hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. THE CAT\\'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd\\'s pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a \"\"comedy\"\" and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in Germany in that year. The Production Code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that FDR\\'s America was secure enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler\\'s Germany, Stalin\\'s USSR, or Mussolini\\'s Italy. But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? Lloyd\\'s unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he\\'d had a sense of humor, of course. It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. Impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin\\'s THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn\\'t amusing.\",neg\\r\\n\"Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie centers around some freak named \"\"luther\"\". Luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time), runs amuck at the local Kroger grocery by eating an old woman\\'s neck with his metal teeth.Luther runs to farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, and gets chased, and gets killed. Oh, and the chick from the SUPERBOY tv show gets naked.\",neg\\r\\n\"So many great talents were utilized in \"\"The Best Years of Out Lives\"\", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. Think of what its director, William Wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles, he was making a film that argued that the US\\'s leaders were themselves profoundly anti-individual--that they had \"\"wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war--which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under.\"\" There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, Gregg Toland\\'s cinematography and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of \"\"The Road to Rome\"\" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O\\'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael into a large-scale but thematic drama. The clever plot line was the experiences of thee \"\"couples\"\" after the soldiers (three being spotlighted) tried to return home to a \\'victory culture\"\". Their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that \"\"all was well with \"\"America\"\"\"\". March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he is drinking; O\\'Donnell\\'s young man, Harold Russell,, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living; and worst of all Andrews\\' wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job, to consideration on his individual merits, to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk--for nothing, and loss of everything he had ever had. The shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again,each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting--each for his own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self, anti-reality indifferent an un-American United States. Wyler\\'s direction, especially of the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed B-17, alone and the scene of Russell\\'s wedding is wonderful indeed. This is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms, one women and men can agree on for once. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff add to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in stunning B/W.\",pos\\r\\n\"If you find the first 30 minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you\\'re watching it, don\\'t give up. Also, hearing the Danish language is a bit new to most North Americans, who don\\'t see and hear a lot of Danish films. Anyway, as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his/her patience.Being a fan of the movie, \"\"Out Of Africa,\"\" this film piqued my interest because it\\'s based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the major character in that film.The meal - Babette\\'s feast - was amazing. I\\'m no chef, but I was impressed! How one interprets the story, too, varies, I suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise. If the latter, how you look at the definition of \"\"legalism\"\" can affect how you interpret this story.In any case, it\\'s a fine film, but don\\'t watch this if you\\'re dieting.\",pos\\r\\n\"I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you\\'re going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn\\'t think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I\\'m even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That\\'s how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don\\'t know & have it be over a movie. If someone could kindly retract what they said about the storyline, I would be more than happy to retract my insult. However, if they feel that I am not worthy of a retraction, I might just feel that they are not worthy of one either. But I can\\'t control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they don\\'t have to make a retraction, but I would greatly appreciate it.\",pos\\r\\n\"Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), head of a seriously understaffed institute for the insane, takes a \\'progressive\\' approach towards the treatment of his patients, even allowing his loonies complete freedom of the building, day and night; he pays the price for his forward thinking, however, when he rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a log (serves him right for not suggesting basket weaving).Shortly after this tragic incident, nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctor\\'s assistant, and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). Despite being unaware of her deceased predecessor\\'s decision to employ Ms Beale, and not particularly eager to take on new staff, Dr. Masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work, but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital, Charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned away.It doesn\\'t take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital, the \\'lunatics have taken over the asylum\\' schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans, but S.F. Brownrigg\\'s Don\\'t Look In The Basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive-in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters: lobotomised, popsicle-sucking Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams), who recites William Allingham\\'s creepy poem The Fairies and warns Charlotte of impending doom; cackling loon Danny (Jessie Kirby), who delights in teasing the other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks her doll is a real baby; army nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love (ie., she tries to jump any man who goes near her).This convincingly crazy set of characters, plus a bit of gore and nudity, reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the impressive white trash horror Scum of the Earth), and a solid turn from Playboy covergirl Holotik, all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable, low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker.\",pos\\r\\n\"Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal, and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible! She slauters the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn\\'t understand. I also think the chorus isn\\'t up to snuff. They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is okay, but Sweeney Todd can be so much more if done correctly. This production doesn\\'t come near the level this material demands. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.\",neg\\r\\n\"There\\'s not really that much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically it\\'s a few episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a film. It is extremely dated, however. Winky\\'s treatment of Vena is a good example of this.

You\\'ll see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Schultz role. He does a pretty good job in it. All in all, I\\'d give it a 6 out of 10. Not great, but not bad.\",neg\\r\\n\"Yes I AM a FF7 fan, but how many people who watch this movie are NOT going to be? And so, I\\'m reviewing this movie from a FF7 fan perspective, and with no regret. (I would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the FF7 game.)Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent Children. It\\'s a sensory delight - a complete audio-video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: some feats were accomplished that I would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature. When the action scenes came about, they were, for lack of a more accurate word, a roller-coaster. With dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range, to seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at the crucial moments, to the sheer level of detail - it\\'s all hard to fault. The animation looks big budget, the style and imagery is awesome, and the effects at times made me forget that I was watching animation rather than live action footage. I could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals, but it simply wouldn\\'t do it any justice.Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices for all the characters didn\\'t disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. The music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best game soundtrack EVER, transfered beautifully to the movie. Most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie, albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what\\'s going on. There was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all fitted in well with the movie\\'s situation at the corresponding time.Story - 7/10 The story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. Both aspects were simply not up to par with the game - but then again, the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the movie only has about 90 minutes. As far as the story goes, the plot wasn\\'t bad or anything, but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through. In effect, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression/development, that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the movie took the more sensible approach - to expand on the action and try to place as many inside-jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor, which was originally such a driving force in the game. The lack of Materia usage also caused me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not ZERO) Materia, and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill. I would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate Materia much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film. There were also many plot holes in the movie - all which can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well.Characters - 7/10 The characters, whilst all being present in one form or another, don\\'t necessarily shine to their true potential. There simply isn\\'t really enough movie-time to spend with all of them. And so, all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased, and in some cases, barely at all (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). Even Cloud, who is the focal point of the movie, I feel doesn\\'t use enough of his familiar abilities from the game. The Materia issue is a strong reason for this. With that said, it\\'s a joy to see the cast back in action, even if it\\'s in such a role that doesn\\'t utilise them to their fullest. The new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however - the Bad Guy Trio and the kid dude Denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it, but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing.Value - 10/10 The replay value for this movie is excellent - I personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way - bigger screen, louder volume.Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the flaws of the movie, they simply weren\\'t big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it, and I honestly think that will be the same case for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children tremendously, and encourage fellow FF7 fans to go see it.\",pos\\r\\n\"This show is brilliantly hilarious! I started watching in 2007, and had never heard of it before then.

We don\\'t usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn\\'t start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I\\'m not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of \"\"appointment\"\" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don\\'t like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn\\'t have a DVR yet). So I guess it wasn\\'t until TBS starting running reruns on their daily lineup in the evenings that we started watching consistently.By the time we got hooked, there were only a couple more season\\'s left before the series was canceled. But we still watch it almost daily on TBS. I almost prefer to see series this way, because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and what\\'s going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week.But the episodes stand alone in the since that the stories don\\'t carry over from week to week. But that is fine with me, because you can watch an episode, then miss weeks - and still pick back up.My only criticism is the writing wasn\\'t always consistent. Some episodes would be outrageously hilarious, and then some would only be mildly funny. So, I\\'m not sure it had the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved the casting and the characters are all quite believable and realistic. Kevin James is just plain funny to look at! So even if the plot isn\\'t that great, James body language and expressions make the show worth watching. Leah Remini is great as the \"\"play-it-straight\"\" wife. I think its harder to play the straight character for laughs, than the comedic character, and she does a great job. She has a knack at sarcasm and insults like no one else. She is one tough cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie\\'s dad, who lives with them in their basement. This a great series and I was sorry when it cancelled. But a big thanks to TBS for keeping the King alive in reruns!\",pos\\r\\n\"If you\\'ve got a box of tissues, a comfy couch, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a Friday night, this is definitely your movie! Its romantic, its hot and its challenging. For most of us gay people, religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and probably just starred at the alter boy and how cute he was! But in Latter Days, you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world revolves around belief\\'s which totally contradict being gay. The two main cast members were totally hot, but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make me \\'almost\\' cry (I have never cried in a movie!), which I thought was quite impressive for a B grade movie. I highly recommend this flick, you will laugh, you will cry (unless your me) and you will definitely drool! I love it so much I even purchased the DVD for my collection. Its truly the most beautiful movie ever\",pos\\r\\n\"As a fan of the old Doctor Who, and after the mediocre Fox movie, I was dubious of this new series of Doctor Who. I gave it a chance though, and am so glad I did.Yes, some episodes aren\\'t as brilliant as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, Eccleston\\'s Doctor is far from any we\\'ve had before but... Eccleston\\'s Doctor is just about the best there is. His performance is at times comical, at others dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic.This, and Bille Piper as Rose make this series a cut above the rest (Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Rose\\'s mum), and there is a depth to this series not present previously. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its Sci-Fi. I mean who\\'d have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a Dalek prior to this, how many times in this series\\' history have we had moments like those with Rose\\'s dad, the Emergency Doctor and the \\'You were fantastic...so was I\\' final speech? I advise anyone, whether a fan of Doctor Who or even TV drama to buy this set on DVD, it truly is \"\"Fantastic!\"\".Now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new Cybermen) I have to say that David Tennant\\'s Doctor is just not as good, of course you may disagree, but I don\\'t think his Doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series. I also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last, however the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a true gem. Not to say this series is not good, just not quite AS good.So whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, The Doctor is back, and he\\'s here to stay. \"\"Fantastic!\"\" - Almost as many \"\"Fantastic!\"\"\\'s as The Doctor! -\",pos\\r\\n\"I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I\\'d seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP\\'s work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time. The mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. The story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bitter-sweet ending, being the perfect climax for this perfect journey. The construction of the film itself is a master craft. The skilled use of innovative resources (like stills stitching Danny\\'s memories into the film) will compare to those hand-made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable. Blind Spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a great off-the-wall romantic comedy about love, work, pandering to the public taste, and midlife crises. The main character is a talented movie director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get himself out of hock with the IRS. It has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadpan to slapstick), and fine writing. It\\'s also a wry send-up of the movie industry. The metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the movie that\\'s being made, and in some places the film departs from strict realism. The result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor.\",pos\\r\\n\"Cowardly and cynical, `The Hospital\\' represents the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky\\'s special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire.Thanks to ham-handed director Arthur Hiller, this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly, poorly paced presentation it deserves.Only a great performance by George C. Scott, in the sort of mean-spirited role he was born to play, keeps `The Hospital\\' from being a complete disaster.Ironically, though, Scott\\'s performance does viewers a disservice. His magnetism keeps them watching when they might more profitably turn off the VCR and clean out the closets, stare at the clouds, or watch re-runs of `Baywatch.\\'Certainly, anyone who emotionally invests in the set-up _ modern medicine apparently gone amok _ will feel cheated by the dismal payoff, where Chayefsky reveals that The System Works Just Fine, So Quit Your Carping.While the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy, it all turns out to be a red herring. Before that becomes clear, though, Chayefsky gives some good lines to Scott as his middle-aged, middle-class, white male stand-in.Bitter, alcoholic, impotent, Scott\\'s Dr. Herbert Bock has alienated those who know him best, and he has the bile to keep alienating them. In Chayefsky\\'s worldview, all that of course makes Bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his age.Playing a collection of adjectives, the long-haired, long-legged, braless and almost bust-less Diana Rigg struggles in the part of `the girl.\\' The British Rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress would struggle as well. Like the rest of a good cast gone to waste, Rigg can\\'t overcome a script that isn\\'t interested in any character except Bock, or any philosophy beyond banality.For fans of George C. Scott, this is another star turn and worth watching. For fans of black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For anyone else, don\\'t bother.\",neg\\r\\n\"Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining AND memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David \"\"The Big Apple\"\") misadventures into the world of first-time sex and true love. Along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow hopeless romantic Gary (The main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it\\'s ending. If you haven\\'t been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look...sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. L.A.V. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it\\'s genre.\",pos\\r\\n\"The basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so I won\\'t bother. I\\'d like to first commend the producer, cast, directors and crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a meager, $1M budget, a small fraction of standard Hollywood fare that doesn\\'t LOOK cheap. These people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it. This is essentially art for art\\'s sake. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that\\'s fine. I for one am glad that people like these will continue to put forth the time and effort for our benefit without expecting huge multimillion dollar payoffs.Now to the criticism. I feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point. It\\'s wonderful when everything works out and the hero/heroine saves the day and all\\'s well that ends well. What gets me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind luck is responsible more than courage and strength.When lee was attacked but not severely injured, somehow she washed up on a mud bank right next to the dead guide. Then, miraculously, his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it actually works (after some cleaning and fiddling). Finally, when Lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps in the water, once again the croc fails to kill her. She ends up with her hand in his (her?) mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger, ultimately to blow the croc\\'s brains out (literally).I came to the conclusion that having Lee go hand to mouth with the croc was just a way to end the film with the human in triumph. Based upon what I have seen, the croc\\'s attack and continue to hold on until the prey stops struggling. Croc\\'s will spin around and around to dismember and drown the prey. That happened to the first 3 victims but not to Lee. She had teeth marks but they were not deep.I think that the ending would have been better had the croc won, frankly, thereby proving his dominance of the mangrove, his territory for millions of years. But then, how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl didn\\'t get out alive?\",pos\\r\\n\"This has to be one of the most powerful message-sending movies i saw lately, it was absolutely flawless all the way, amazingly original and thought provoking. Story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very very powerful. It\\'s about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend\\'s retarded kid brother, and as he is sent to juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you don\\'t let it go until the very end. Murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased, and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more, it\\'s a total tour de force, cause those actions cannot be described by simple words. His motive of committing murder is left incompletely explained, and it makes viewers think. Acting was pretty much flawless, and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces. If you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during them(e.g. \\'Donnie Darko\\', \\'Mulholland Dr.\\') then \\'The United States of Leland\\' is an excellent movie choice for you, otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you\\'re in the mood for serious thought provoking movie.10/10\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie was, of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years/ still in love/ not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress-woman\\'s party? This film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of African-Americans that I have ever seen. It makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look downright progressive! I have scarcely seen a movie that I disliked this much. UGH!\",neg\\r\\n\"This film brought me to tears. I have to say, that if I did not have a beautiful husband at home, I would ask this beautiful piece of art to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes quick and witty dialogue that only furthers the genius of Carter\\'s performance. Kyle is pretty gay, but his performance was nothing less than spectacular. He is also very handsome and cute. I\\'m thinking about asking him out on a date and giving him a very sweet goodnight gift.;)If you would like to discuss this film in the future, please contact me.Nick Burrell Vassar Class of 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126\",pos\\r\\nOnce again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot.

Though Bugs proves he\\'s the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this. If he weren\\'t so dumb he\\'d know it REALLY is duck season and just blast Daffy. But poor old Daff can\\'t believe the utter preposterousness of the situation.

I knew nothing about Leigh Scott when I rented it, and would not have done so if I had known that most of his previous films were horror films. I am not into that at all, I was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report.Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing about it for me, was that it made me want to read the report, to figure out what the heck this movie was about.I wrote this because I am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on TV, that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that I read.\",neg\\r\\n\"I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood, I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday, since it originally played on USA networks. Does Anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again. I don\\'t think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about, people only know of the Stepford wives and Stepford husband movies. No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version. Maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller/horror flicks.

Thanks Taira tcampo23@aol.com\",pos\\r\\n\"I have wanted to say this since I first saw the movie, I still will not allow any of my children or grandchildren to watch this. At least not until I tell them and they understand that it is completely fiction. The only thing that I saw that was correct was that animals went onto the Ark, everything else was false. Lot and Noah fighting on the ocean like a pirate movie. Make sure you tell your kids the real story before you allow them to watch it, but really, until they are old enough to understand that it is not real they may have a messed up vision of the Bible. This was the worst Bible movie I have ever seen. Bruce and Evan Almighty were much better and had more to teach. Let your children watch those\",neg\\r\\n\"The Three Stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history. For that reason alone, they deserved a much better ending at Columbia than they received with this short.\"\"Sappy Bullfighters\"\" is just not good. Granted, this is not all Joe Besser\\'s fault. I personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough, simply because of the departure from the Stooges usual fanfare that they contain, and for the fact that Larry is sometimes showcased more. However, this short just will not do. And the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown, well that just adds to the overall disgust.This film just epitomizes how short subjects were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them. This short is so sloppy. It is a simple re-make of a Curly short, \"\"What\\'s the Matador?\"\", filmed years before. As if this fact wasn\\'t bad enough, the studio actually threw in footage of Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years prior). Are these things not obvious? Laughable or sad? You be the judge.Another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a Joe Besser showcase, with him showing that all he is (at least in this film) is a Curly-wanna-be-gone-completely-wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short. As a Larry fan, I also must say that I feel it a bit disgraceful to have Besser get to use the joke that Larry originally popularized in the short \"\"Ants In The Pantry\"\". To see Besser say \"\"I can\\'t see, I can\\'t see!\"\" and have Larry say the simple \"\"Why can\\'t you see?\"\", while Besser gets to quip \"\"I got my eyes closed\"\", is just wrong on all levels.The two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years, Howard and Fine, have so little to do in this short. There are hardly any funny bits with them. The only thing that qualifies is Larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, attempting to be \"\"Pepe\"\", his dog.One can\\'t blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give it their all. No matter how ridiculous things could get (and I\\'m sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers) Howard and Fine never gave anything less than their best. Their efforts do not pale from 1934-1959.I often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible. I\\'m all for their more \"\"experimental\"\", unusual shorts. At least those contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone can agree, is just not good.Thank goodness TV later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed. Had they been forced to go out in THIS fashion, well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh.\",neg\\r\\n\"The real Best Picture of 1947 also deals with Anti-Semitism and is superior to Elia Kazan\\'s GENTLEMEN\\'S AGREEMENT (the eventual winner at that year\\'s Academy Awards) in practically every department. Edmard Dmytryk\\'s near-perfect direction, John Paxton\\'s terse script and J. Roy Hunt\\'s expert Expressionist lighting are wonderfully abetted by a superb ensemble cast. Although Robert Young (playing an easy-going, methodical and very likable cop) and Robert Mitchum (who actually does have the occasional throwaway witty remark) are the nominal stars of the film, it\\'s Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame - as well as Paul Kelly, in the small but pivotal role of Grahame\\'s pathetic husband - who give the film\\'s most memorable characterizations; Ryan proved so convincing as a homicidal racist that he was eventually typecast for a while, excelling in equally villainous roles in such films as ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1952), THE NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also notable for its atypical structure in that Ryan\\'s \"\"flashback\"\" sequence, a complete fabrication, is shot in a straightforward manner while the actual truth emerges from the hazy, distorted recollections of the real protagonist of the film who, furthermore, isn\\'t even played by any of the film\\'s stars! Also, CROSSFIRE was originally to have treated homosexuality (as per Richard Brooks\\' original source novel, \"\"The Brick Foxhole\"\") but this taboo subject was unacceptable to the Hays Office at the time - a far cry from the situation we have today when (at least) 3 gay-themed films are in the running for this years\\' major Oscars!The print utilized for Warners\\' DVD transfer shows some regrettable signs of wear-and-tear at times but the Audio Commentary by noir experts, James Ursini and Alain Silver, is a good one, even though I don\\'t happen to share their opinion that Dmytryk\\'s career declined steadily after his HUAC troubles, as such excellent pictures as THE SNIPER (1952), THE CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), THE YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) amply prove; having said that his collaborations at RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945; hopefully this will be part of the next Film Noir Box Set from Warners) and CROSSFIRE - do constitute his best work. In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s but also one of the finest noirs ever made, period.\",pos\\r\\n\"It\\'s very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer. While some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves, I embrace \"\"Uzumaki\"\" for its irreverence. There is a PLOT, it\\'s just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. This is a film that invites numerous interpretations, as all great art does - however, this film is also very entertaining, making it a rare film experience. It\\'s simultaneously provocative and fun.\",pos\\r\\n\"Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre film, and this movie proves it. He turns in a very realistic performance as a small-time horse trainer and single father, not sugar-coating either role.He can be, by turns, soft-hearted and doting, then iron-handed to his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he doesn\\'t want his young prospect racing horse overworked and hurt in small-time races, but he seems to be willing to risk the horse\\'s life when he gets into the big time).This is just one of Matthau\\'s wonderful performances, and one that I highly recommend.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is full of pseudo deep thoughtfulness and it\\'s cloying in its writerly-ness, that includes a canned ham voice-over and some unbelievable dialogue. Dialogue that is tinny and tone deaf the way Spike sometimes (not always) is when writing \"\"certain\"\" characters. For those that like nonsense films like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, this is another one for you.That said, this comment is nothing against Ryan Gosling who has shown his awesome chops in The Believer. A film that proves that movies are a director\\'s medium, and when a movie is rotten it\\'s fair to say the fault lies there and not in the actors.\",neg\\r\\n\"Due to the fact that in 1976 there were no CGI I felt that the movie was quite watchable. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. The actors did OK considering the premise of the film being set in a type of Jules Vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were at most improbabilities. Had I watched this film in 1976 I probably would have been in awe of the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to the earths core. I still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but I digress. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions toward each other which of course makes the film somewhat campy which I loved. The \\'monsters\\' left something to be desired but the story had a good premise although I feel as though some other sort of \\'thing\\' could have been more believable under those circumstances. All in all quite watchable for its time and fun now.\",pos\\r\\n\"By Randolph Scott standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointing and heavy-handed star western. Two or three of the characters could be dispensed with, while two or three other characters could be given more prominence. (The humour needs to be completely rewritten.) De Toth handles the action well - as always - but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak.\",neg\\r\\n\"Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching thismovie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases.

The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad.

It\\'s music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he\\'ll see the Snow Queen is not so bad. She only tries to surround Herself with love in the wrong way. The evening this movie was on here (first part) I only watched it, because I was bored, but I loved it a lot more after and was very angry, when they didn\\'t show the next part because of the Pope\\'s funeral...

I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin.

The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli\\'s bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots.

The Dr. Doom and (especially) Thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent. Director Oley Sassone can\\'t even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind woman\\'s POV, the dialogue is absolutely dismal, the team\\'s costumes don\\'t fit properly, and the effects are appalling: the Human Torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens, while Mr. Fantastic\\'s powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible, and while it\\'s hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release, it\\'s equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good.\",neg\\r\\n\"Do you know that they want to escavate the Moon for real?And in Geneve there is the debated project that could lead to make possible time machine?All i can say about this movie that is based on facts about future(at the time of the movie)scientifical projects but real.

That\\'s because Ghoulies 4 really gets the big 1 (from me it does).\",neg\\r\\n\"This is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen. Even if you didn\\'t like this film\\'s antecedents, \\'The Bad News Bears\\' and \\'The Mighty Ducks,\\' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, \"\"Don\\'t bother with us, we\\'re all losers,\"\" you can see everything that\\'s coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. All the usual suspects are here. Besides the spunky teacher, we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids (they\\'re brats, yes, but no so endearing), a slow-witted small town sheriff that they love to torment, an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team, etc., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d\\'Abo as the new teacher displays any likabilty. I never cared much for Steve Guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn\\'t change things. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work with. Let\\'s hope that writer/director Holly Goldberg Sloan comes up with something better next time out.\",neg\\r\\n\"The Evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is foolishly unleashed to torture all inside. What a washout of a movie! There\\'s not a single scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna overplays a nothing role. There\\'s some animated ghosts, a disfigurement by power saw, and a ghost-rape. After nothing special happens for almost the whole movie The Evil gets personified into...Victor Buono. Great! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono is scary. He looks like he was on the bum for a guest starring paycheck to pay his liquor bill. By then its too late to turn it off, because the damn thing is over. I felt like throwing the videocassette out the window. Please avoid this junk! Hopefully it will never see the light of DVD and will fade into obscurity.\",neg\\r\\n\"I rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend`s place and it was an instant success.The classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70`s australian twist.The acting isn`t exactly shakespeare society stuff here,but later ,\"\"Mad max\"\"star Bruce Spence is a beautifully understated surfie/scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay as a deliciously 70`s camp fairy godmother/father character.Also note the musical contribution from ex-Daddy Cool frontman Ross Wilson on the title song.In a similar vein to later-day aussie comedies such as \"\"Priscilla queen of the desert\"\".Good fun.\",pos\\r\\n\"Someone definitely has it in for The Wind and I cannot believe that what I saw on the screen has much to do with it. This is a better and more solid movie than most of the independents I watch all year long. The cinematography displays a genuine love and mastery of the craft and the casting was just fine. I would love to see more of these folks, especially Zeke Rippy.As far as the story and script, I\\'m not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intent of informing anybody else about the movie. The long drawn out nit-picky bashing posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this site by the reviewer, are obvious slander directed at the producers of the film. I don\\'t know the inside story, but it would probably make a good movie. What I do know from being around this biz, is, productions that try to make everybody happy usually end up being awful and when the filmmaker has the guts, drive and common sense to \"\"kill the babies\"\", someone always ends up with hurt feelings. That\\'s part of the biz too, and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business. Of course, the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those that snubbed them (read: were honest and truthful with them). And that is my best guess to explain the nasty, nasty reviews. In as much as there is a grain of truth behind everything, there is a point to be made, but these exaggerations of the grains are so over the top that they become obviously fictitious.It\\'s not a slasher blood bath if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for, it\\'s more the psychological suspense thriller, which typically is not appreciated by the lowest common denominators out there. The best way to see this movie is to try to expunge any pre-conceived notions, pop it in and let it unfold - seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say, I don\\'t think you can come away with the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed. Poorly understood perhaps.Overall, I do agree that this is a nicely done, compelling movie. Perhaps I would not have given it a 9 under normal circumstances, but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the picture (I have a secret love for really bad cinema). To me, the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shlocky, inept, poorly acted and stupidly written movies. None of that applies here - it is quality movie making with some real talent in there. I gave it the nine to to tip the scales back in the correct direction. Watch the movie and tell me I am wrong.\",pos\\r\\n\"BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of brief vignettes that are a clever way of starting a story about TV anchors who have no clue as to what they\\'re reporting about.At a speech before a group of would-be reporters, all of whom are bored by her presentation, most of them leave. When the last one exits, the co-host of the event says quietly to HOLLY HUNTER: \"\"I don\\'t think there will be any Q&A.\"\" Subtle line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy, a farce about the show biz aspect of TV anchoring.WILLIAM HURT is the inept news anchor who finds himself working with HOLLY HUNTER as the network anchorman. Hurt badly needs help in remedial reporting and Holly refuses to take the bait--at first. He knows he\\'s only capable of looking good, but is not a reporter. He proves to be a quick study as long as his earpiece is working and he\\'s getting all the straight info from executive producer Hunter.Holly\\'s other anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps by feeding her information she passes on to Hurt. Of course she becomes conflicted about her feelings for ace reporter Brooks and equally strong attraction to the pretty-boy anchorman Hurt, who\\'s having his own dalliance with a pretty staff member.You have to wait until twenty minutes before the film ends to find out which man she\\'ll end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she\\'s against. In this unpredictable comedy, there\\'s no telling who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will end up with.Fittingly, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were all nominated for Oscars (Brooks in supporting role), as was the film itself and director/writer James L. Brooks. All in all, seven well deserved Oscar nominations.The script doesn\\'t opt for a conventional happy ending--and, in this case, that\\'s the only flaw for the brilliant screenplay. I felt cheated and somewhat let down by the wistful conclusion.\",pos\\r\\n\"A truly terrific, touching film. Female melodrama at its finest, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to the story because it\\'s a classic: you\\'re in love with \"\"Mr. Right\"\" but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head-over-heels in love. But of course, it\\'s not that simplistic. The characters are real and all of the performances are perfect. The movie is hilarious as well, every scene skewers society. I\\'d recommend this film to anyone who loves a well-written screenplay of humor and melodrama. You can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A great, underrated movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"\\'This Life\\' is truly as bad as it gets. Its cast of mercenary, lascivious, ruthless, duplicitous, shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its post-eighties setting and I have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation. Unfortunately, it leaves me nothing to sympathise with or care about and I regard it as just another step toward the television premium-rate phone in scams; astonishingly bad, cheap, reality and \\'celebrity\\' saturated television; and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and, indeed, much of British society. Sounds exaggerated? I don\\'t think it is. In this regard programs such as \\'This Life\\' have indeed been as influential as they are often called.\",neg\\r\\nThe Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It\\' s set on a country house on a weekend. As always all the guests are suspects and it\\'s up to Poirot to figure out the truth. With movies like this it\\'s always best not to give too much away so I\\'ll stop here. What I loved in the `Hollow\\' was that it\\'s a mystery the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. Everybody seems to be the culprit. There\\'s that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story.You can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience.The actors are all very good. As a curiosity notice Edward Hardwicke who played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see him after a few years. Suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time.I did find out who the murderer was but still it\\'s not predictable and It\\'s also very believable.So in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure.,pos\\r\\n\"Well, this is new...Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director called...Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences, it becomes hard for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can\\'t seem to keep Fulci on the right track... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci\\'s most pleasant films. The gore is overpowering and copious, to say the least. The amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version (referred to with the aka:\"\"Nightmare Concert\"\"). Decapitations all around, victims \\' intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime! The film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon (since it\\'s so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there\\'s beer in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional viewpoint, this production can\\'t exactly be called a masterpiece! There\\'s not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty-headed. In order to make more room for the gore, characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death. Especially compared with Fulci\\'s highlights - like \"\"The Beyond\"\" or \"\"Don\\'t Torture a Duckling\"\" - this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack. The best way to interpret \"\"Cat in the Brain\"\" is like a personal statement made by Fulci and a direct attack towards censorship. Perhaps after seeing so many of his films \\xc2\\x96 especially the latter ones \\xc2\\x96 being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply can\\'t be cut! If you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick make-up effects, you only got about 10 minutes of footage left! Especially because the insane killings re-occur later in the film as Fulci hallucinates about them again. You can almost hear our director think stuff like: \"\"Let\\'s see how you\\'re going to censor this now!\"\" Even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background. Are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives? Are there any police officers looking for clues that\\'ll lead them to the killer? You don\\'t know and Lucio doesn\\'t bother to inform you about that, because that would lead to sequences that don\\'t require cutting. Oh, and it\\'s pretty damn pretentious as well! The name \"\"Mr. Fulci\"\" or even \"\"Lucio\"\" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the entire movie, to be exact) and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change. Hey, I certainly don\\'t blame him...After over 30 years of delivering amusing movies; he deserved to have a little extra fun. You\\'re a God, Mr. Fulci!\",pos\\r\\n\"It\\'s interesting to watch how late 1950\\'s society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn\\'t changed men all that much, but \"\"sexual harassment\"\" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it\\'s charming in an innocent, pass\\xc3\\xa9 way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing \"\"The Best Of Everything\"\" on the soundtrack. I want to jump right into some scenes, filmed on N.Y. streets, circa 1959 & experience a time I\\'ve only seen on film & in photographs. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith\\'s \"\"Working Girl\"\". Especially when Hope Lange (who\\'s a cross between Grace Kelly & Dolores Hart) gets bombed in handsome Stephen Boyd\\'s apartment, he tucks her in & just watches her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if \"\"anything\"\" happened between them the following day). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weaver\\'s horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty (with a soft core), but Sigourney\\'s character was sweet on the outside & horrible on the inside. I found it distressing how the Suzy Parker character (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress, who supposedly didn\\'t need a man to complete her, ended up. She becomes a stalker/lunatic/nut-job when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after he\\'s done with her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you enjoy films like \"\"Valley Of The Dolls\"\" you\\'ll like this one too.\",pos\\r\\n\"Crazy Scottish warrior race, stranded deep in outer-space, low on food and budget free, started ten now down to three, who will help these men of pluck, with visual effects that semi suck, but I kinda liked the freaky being, if I met one then I\\'d be fleeing, but not if I had Scottish mates, we\\'d f\\'n swear and avoid that fate, so in the end it wasn\\'t botched, it was a DVD I\\'m glad I watched, but if they ever make a sequel, dump some actors, not all were equal, some were good, with gritty acting, some were wooden, and should maybe pack it in, but the action kept me watching all, the shooting, shouting, didn\\'t stall, I\\'ll tell my friends not to fear, and watch again in another year.\",pos\\r\\n\"It\\'s a long time ago I saw this movie and still it\\'s one of the worst I\\'ve ever seen. I like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. This could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. I didn\\'t want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted to watch it. I didn\\'t know it was such a crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas, killing everybody on their way (especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at its turning point, in the titty twister bar everything changed. Stupid Vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like \\'Nightmare on Elmsteet\\'. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love bloodstolling thrillers don\\'t watch it at all, you will be very disappointed at the end.\",neg\\r\\n\"I truly enjoyed this film. It\\'s rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well. In this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion. Both women deliver warm, touching and at times humorous performances. The film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. And yet the approach wasn\\'t heavy handed. The production values were also top notch for a small budget film. I saw this at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. It was a real crowd pleaser. Everyone I spoke to seemed to enjoy this film.\",pos\\r\\nThis movie was obscenely obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. Following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with pointless and poorly thought out lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies. This movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the Bachelor and Bachelorette but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to be without ever having to watched the movie before. The casting was fine but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then should have been used and said lines in was that wanted you to change the channel quickly. As a note please don\\'t watch this movie.,neg\\r\\n\"I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn\\'t always the way with Buster\\'s comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.) If I had to describe this film in one word I\\'d call it \"\"effortless,\"\" but if I were permitted two I\\'d call it \"\"seemingly effortless,\"\" for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease. Still, they didn\\'t call him the Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweat.A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set \"\"along Millionaires\\' Row,\"\" i.e. on a bread line in a grim urban setting, where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and, as a result, doesn\\'t get fed. But it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. Before long, through a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is believed to be an escaped killer named Dead Shot Dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around, and yet while he\\'s clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him, and that he hasn\\'t time to feel sorry for himself anyway, he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap.Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either, which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most laugh-packed short comedies in existence. This is the film that features that iconic shot of Buster riding a train\\'s cow-catcher right up to the very lens of the camera, which isn\\'t a gag exactly but sure is laugh-provoking in its own strange way. Meanwhile, there are gags involving guns, dogs, cops, an incredibly furry mustache, and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Buster\\'s weight (a surreal sight indeed), but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when Buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis, Big Joe Roberts, a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox. Trapped in Big Joe\\'s dining room, Buster leap-frogs over him and sails through a transom, turns a phone-booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear, and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade-out gag.To say more would be a disservice to first-time viewers. I only wish I could see this film in a theater full of people who\\'d never seen it before, and float on the laughter. Live musical accompaniment would be nice too; and incidentally the musical score supplied by Kino for their home video/DVD version of THE GOAT is first-rate, serving as icing on an already tasty cake.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is one of those movies where you have to put to one side some of its obvious shortcomings (a result of the date and location of its production)and accentuate the positive. In many ways this is a truly superb film.Forgive the parody in the one line summary, but the most serious shortcoming for an English speaker like me was the ghastly subtitles. The print I saw had 1982 Soviet \"\"Film Export\"\" subtitles, which consistently used inverted grammar, presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech. The actual impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles which means you spend less time looking at the images. Given that the cinematographic imagery is this films great strength, this is a real issue.Other IMDB-niks have written plenty about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this film (just in case the viewer doesn\\'t notice them for him/herself). They have also written plenty about the battle on the ice scene, which is superb in my view. The love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely..... almost totally lacks charm also. But it is good to cringe every now and then.I was familiar with the Prokofiev music to this film long before seeing the film. The images and the music complement each other marvelously. And it is the images that will stick in the mind for a long time. Bergman clearly learned a lot from these images - the imagery of his medieval pieces (e.g. The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring) building upon and enhancing Eisenstein\\'s ideas. This film was made in 1938 in the USSR. In that context it is a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. For the modern viewer, I suggest that you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on show.\",pos\\r\\n\"Oldboy\\' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.Trusting the latest Hollywood fad, vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent, asexual, love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore. This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past... well, at least in the second half.\\'Thirst\\' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story. The vampire transformation of a priest is, over quite some time, sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, which makes for some awkward viewing. But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory. Well, maybe not so surprisingly if you know \\'Oldboy\\' and \\'I\\'m a Cyborg but that\\'s OK\\', but I guess it\\'s fair to say that \\'Thirst\\' beats Park\\'s earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence. All in all, be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick. It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. \\'Thirst\\' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun-wook\\'s earlier endeavors.\",pos\\r\\n\"The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie. This one though, is missed bigtime. The movie looks chaotic, has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad.Im in agreement with a lot of comments that Lee Jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field. In this one, he is heading the emergency office. Being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes. Clever thinking. Ann Heche touching walls and walking in tunnels that suppose to be 678 degrees fahrenheit. Yea right. Aside from the bad acting those factual errors make the film look almost as silly as Armageddon. The only good point of this movie is that there is no Ben Affleck to make matters even worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.\",neg\\r\\n\"Opie, Tom Gilson,was my brother,so I went to see the movie and I never looked at it again in all these years. Sorry! it was bad.

Tom and Tuesday Weld were to be \"\" introduced \"\" in this picture and Tom was told to take Tuesday to the premiere but Tom said no he was going with Joan Collins, and he did and because he did only Tuesday Weld was Introduced. I found this very funny back then and still do. The movie, while the concept was a funny one, and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just did\\'nt come out funny.The continuity was abstract, at best,it was like I was watching 2 different movies at the same time,each running into the other.

One of 4 films Scott made at RKO during his prime (1947) the others are always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorns into Trail Street, the town\\'s main street, and the sod-busters who feed our bellies. It\\'ll take a strong man like Bat Masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order. More I won\\'t say, except that Scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor, courage, level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a Scott movie with confidence they\\'d learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-stars in this film, playing a good guy for a change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many WORLD WAR II HEROS who starred in America\\'s movies. How sad what we get these days. George Clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left. I wonder how all this plays out in Liberal, Kansas. Liberal, after all, was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.\",pos\\r\\n\"What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved better than this. To start at the beginning, JT was horribly miscast in the lead here. The role called for someone who could convince as a broken-down anti-hero, someone who could look haunted and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton would have fit the bill, or even Al Pacino, but JT is just too alive, and looks to be having too much fun. Also, surely someone who has been through the mill to the extent JT\\'s character had would have suffered some physical effects? The character presented to the audience looked as if he could start as tight end for the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett faired little better role-wise. Where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been troubling development? And as for the \"\"plot\"\" ... well, none of it makes sense. The characters leap from one frame of mind to another seemingly without cause - and certainly without explanation. The pace of the film also leaves something to be desired, namely, pace. This is a very slow film, not that I have anything against slow films, as long as they are heading somewhere. The pace only picks up towards the very end, when it shifts from a slow dirge to a frantic race to pack in as many tired clich\\xc3\\xa9s as possible. In this it succeeds - the only thing missing being something involving a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one purely for Gabriel Macht\\'s performance - he was the only member of the cast who was a) well cast and b) able to convince in his role. All in all, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours.\",neg\\r\\n\"Sweet, entertaining tale of a young 17 1/2 year old boy, controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father, and how he finds himself through his work with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well acted, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenage boy well, showing his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series of films. Laura Linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption, so there\\'s no room to like her at all.

I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer accepted to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews in IMDb promoting this movie and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review in this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film: my wife and I napped many times because of the monotony of this pointless story, and we used the rewind button of the DVD to repeat each lost scene. However, the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button, to end this crap faster. My vote is one.Title (Brazil): \"\"Cidade Sombria\"\" (\"\"Dark City\"\")\",neg\\r\\n\"I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording/mixing.For whatever reason, they\\'ve had to employ an awful lot of what\\'s called ADR, where the actors replace the original location sound with a re-recording of it in a sound booth.The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain.It wouldn\\'t be so bad if the ADR was done well, but at times it\\'s just plain distracting. It\\'s not just the ADR that\\'s the problem - the sound mix just doesn\\'t match up to the quality of performances and the pictures.I\\'d be curious to know what went wrong.\",pos\\r\\n\"- The Best Bit : When the dull mobster (Nicholas Turturro) calls out to the runaway (Matthew Modine) \"\"Shane !..

I thought that we\\'ll see him again at the end, smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who, in a brief gimmick like this, could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world. - The Most Question I had After The End : When we\\'ll see (The Shipment - 2) ?

As I watched this, I could not decide which was worse, the screenplay, or the directing. The actors are over the top, the art direction looks like a Disney movie, the music is contrived, and the sentiment so sweet that it gives viewers cavities. It\\'s a bad attempt to imitate \"\"FOur Weddings And A funeral\"\". If one wants to watch comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how poor direction can turn a story into cavity sweetness, this is a good one to watch.\",neg\\r\\n\"A very different Jerry Lewis film, not like all those more famous films that everybody knows. Lewis deals with the difficult task of WW II and National Socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way. But even more interesting and important, he does it in a very un-American way. And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry un-American means more sophisticated, more subtle, more intelligent or simply better. That is the reason why the film was no success in the US but a very great success in Europe.All in all, Jerry Lewis has proven by this movie, that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy.\",pos\\r\\n\"Jud Nelson is an aspiring actor who becomes involved with a married couple who enjoy playing sadistic games on other people.

She once dated my brother and she was always really nice! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 or so minutes from fort Steele.

I also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall.But i didn\\'t feel like going to it at the time because i wasn\\'t interested in acting. Now i totally wish i did. This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay. It never came out here, (which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here) so i was excited when it came. I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)\",pos\\r\\n\"Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and Steven Seagal didn\\'t help much. It starts off with some odd religious killings that don\\'t make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but Jack Cole doesn\\'t seem to be who everyone thinks he is until Jack\\'s ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well. It\\'s the same thing as all of his other movies: Smoke past, CIA involvement and now trying to be a normal cop. Why does Steven dress up like he is from a Western movie? And the prayer beeds on top of that make things a little confusing.\",neg\\r\\n\"As a native of the city where the story takes place, Buffalo, NY, it\\'s fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun, too!The small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves.

I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai, India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew. I have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there. Excellent work! Though the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such a work was never attempted on Indian Screen. Overall the movie is great! And hats off to Mr.Maniratnam.Mani Ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this film again and again. An excellent film and a must see.\",pos\\r\\n\"i love this movie. it focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted a date from that popular guy Billy. and some of us haven\\'t been kissed yet, right? be honest!another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing. and whoa, high school life. remember it? the fantasy is finding your true love, when you\\'re 25 and still in high school. not really fantasy, but close enough!although some parts are unbelievable, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job, same as the hilarious David Arquette. the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. didn\\'t i just repeat that?Never Been Kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch. it shows reality and some-not issues for people like you and me.\",pos\\r\\n\"A western through and through. As the title character portrayed by Glenn Ford says, \"\"No, I don\\'t want to fight, but I will if it\\'s forced on me.\"\" This movie is about being intelligent, strong, and fighting for one\\'s beliefs. With courage, never stop striving for what you feel is right. Great action and mostly quick paced. Good to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older western man. Glenn Ford lives up to his western image. Thoroughly enjoyable film includes strategic non-military warfare. Of course it\\'s violent, like the title states, but not too graphic like in the computer-generated era films. It\\'s mostly about strong personality clashes.\",pos\\r\\n\"The art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current Danish cinema! Well, at least it is in this movie. Nobody in this movie are amused. They are all either annoyed or shocked, and if they aren\\'t yet, they soon will be! It is a story of screw-ups, murder, embarrassment, dignity, and, in the end, love and redemption. The chilling, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and won\\'t appeal to everyone, but personally I found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd. You pity the characters from a distance, even as you dislike them up close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them, even when they get away with murder.This is, in my judgment, definitely the best Danish movie of the last few years.9 out of 10.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects aren\\'t worthy of a grade school production. A toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever cache Vincent Price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny. Maybe it was Price\\'s overly dramatic intonation of the oft-used line \"\"They vanished into the Devil\\'s Triangle! [cut to black; next story] Once I started laughing, my friends joined in. Next time Vinny said the crucial line, someone in the back yelled out: \"\"Good!\"\" After that, it got almost as many laughs as a Marx Brothers film. Nobody stayed for the dreadfully serious second feature \"\"Chariots of the Gods.\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"This is my first Almodavar film. I\\'ll confess we chose it mainly because we knew this had the enticing prospect of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes.Unfortunately, that is about all that this film has to recommend it. I consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer, I like European films, \"\"art\"\" films, and I am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not to my particular taste.But this film was a complete blank to me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it a \"\"hilarious comedy\"\" but I didn\\'t laugh once. Loosly and awkwardly constructed, with a lot of pointless dialogue. I don\\'t get this at all-- it seems like an amateurish effort. Can someone enlighten me?\",neg\\r\\n\"The movie \"\"The Cave\"\" has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There was no plot, no story-line, and the lighting was terrible. For most of the movie, I was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights. The persistent \\'grey\\' spaces throughout the movie were irksome. The only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in Hell. All in all, the movie was not really worth watching. If the producers cannot come up with something better than this, they should find another occupation. The underwater scenes were particularly awful, being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights, with the occasional look at the actors. In summation, a really awful movie with bad lighting, extraneous flashes throughout.\",neg\\r\\n\"If you put Seinfeld aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great!\"\"The King Of Queens\"\" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. Doug and Carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face, whether it\\'s Doug\\'s fixation with food or Carrie\\'s obsession with expensive clothing. Doug and Carrie also have to deal with the third, high-maintenance member of the Heffernan household \\xc2\\xad Carrie\\'s twice-widowed father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy \\xc2\\xad his regular excursions with gullible dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Doug\\'s friends Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) round out the cast with their \"\"guy\"\" humor and diverse perspectives.In a manner that evokes \"\"The Honeymooners,\"\" THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in life\\'s everyday situations. Last season alone saw Doug \"\"loaning\"\" Carrie to a wifeless Deacon for help with Thanksgiving dinner; the Heffernans suffering through the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their house; and Doug and Carrie striving to copy a couple whose photos \\xc2\\xad of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie\\'s \\xc2\\xad they accidentally took home. We also watched Arthur grow jealous of a new dog that Holly added to her route, and Doug finding out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog Rocky three times behind his back. Throughout, the series showcases James\\' incredible physical comedy, Remini\\'s hard-edged wit, and Stiller\\'s unique comic presence.You can\\'t... You shoulden\\'t Miss it!\",pos\\r\\n\"I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I\\'m from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there WAY long enough. I don\\'t need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let\\'s make it easy on you. We\\'ll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn\\'t be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): -The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing. Example: Large: \"\"What are you listening to?\"\" Sam: \"\"The Shins. Ever heard of \\'em?\"\" \"\"No.\"\" \"\"Listen to this song - it will change your life!\"\" And then they proceed to play that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (Don\\'t you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? I love that! Hey, they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to \"\"chuckle,\"\" \"\"Say \\'aaaaaw\\'\"\" \"\"cry\"\" \"\"feel inspired\"\" etc.) -The scenes were SO BAD. SO Clich\\xc3\\xa9. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The entire movie. But no, really, example: They\\'re in the rainy quarry by the ark. Large runs up - in the pouring rain (oh he\\'s SO TORMENTED!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! Oh how moving! But wait! Here comes Sam and his buddy (the annoying drug addict), and they ALL SCREAM!!!! BUT WAIT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it comes! THEY KISS!!! LONG, DEEP!!!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! -The dialogue was SO BAD. SO Clich\\xc3\\xa9. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They\\'re leaving the ark and Sam says something like, \"\"Hey. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.\"\" And the guy says back, \"\"You, too.\"\" Oh...Oh my! I never realized...could it be? Oh my God it is! Large\\'s life is like...ohmigod...AN INFINITE ABYSS!!!! Another example: Large and Sam in the airport. Sam says something like, \"\"Is this goodbye?\"\" Not enough for ya? OK, Largeman says something like, \"\"This isn\\'t a period at the end of the sentence... it\\'s an ellipses.\"\" And guess what happens when he tries to walk down the jetway and go back to his life in LA. You know, what? Don\\'t guess. It\\'s a waste of your time.-It\\'s a Grade Z Wes Anderson rip-off movie. When not busy being melodramatic and clich\\xc3\\xa9, the movie spends lots of times with crazy-kooky-off-kilter characters. Hey, Sam\\'s brother... thank you Zach Braff for including him, because it really made the movie so much more textured. Also ripping off Anderson: the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In walks friends, \"\"Vagina!\"\" says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, \"\"Sorry I said vagina.\"\" And Sam says, \"\"It\\'s OK.\"\" -Inventive cinematography that\\'s not inventive but pointless and annoying. Give me a break with the speed-up/slow down of film. Again, Wes Anderson does it effectively in his movies. And it was done well in \"\"Donnie Darko.\"\" But, really, it was pointless. Wow. A crazy party where people are taking X and snorting coke. Better roll out all the tricks! -You can count the good moments on one hand (even if you\\'re missing fingers). That\\'s what makes it even WORSE. The retarded quarterback thing...well, that was good! The little thing he (largeman) says as they\\'re about to enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine)...that was good! Oh, wait, that\\'s about it.You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But, he\\'s likable. But, man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you gotten that yet?), overly cute, overly everything. This movie is terrible. Apparently, I\\'m outnumbered, as this waste of time is currently rated an 8.0.Please, though, if you\\'re looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique DO. NOT. RENT. THIS. MOVIE.\",neg\\r\\n\"I loved this movie. It\\'s a lot of laughs. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I\\'d rather see a hundred movies like this than THREE LORD OF THE RINGS repeating and repeating themselves.It\\'s a low budget affair and seems to be shot on DV but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have a ten line minimum? I\\'m not a critic, just a patron.I doubt very much that Quentin Tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from beginning to end. >\",pos\\r\\n\"The reason why this movie isn\\'t any better known and more appreciated to me seems because of its subject. Because of its controversial subject this movie never got a proper big release and still remains a fairly unknown one to this very day. Not that it\\'s subject is that controversial now anymore though.Basically in essence it\\'s a movie about a white man befriending a black man. The friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic but the way it gets portrayed in this movie makes it all feel very real. We see these different ethnics mingle in with each other, as if it\\'s just completely normal. Unfortunately of course back in those days it really wasn\\'t regarded as anything normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been an hard thing to watch for instance for some proportions of its 1957 audience.You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and still is being respected so much by the Hollywood society and the black-community in general. Of course it\\'s one of the reasons why he also received an Honorary Award at the Oscar\\'s, in 2002. In his movies he often fights against discrimination and prejudiced issues, with of course \"\"In the Heat of the Night\"\" as the best example of this. A real role model, that certainly has inspired many Afro-American actors, to this very day. But on top of that, he also was a great actor. Yes, he is still alive but he has pretty much retired completely from movies now it seems, since his last credited role is from 2001.This movie was Martin Ritt\\'s directorial debut and he also wasn\\'t given too much movie to spend on his movie. The studios were probably also a bit reluctant mainly because of its concept and/or because it was Ritt\\'s first movie. Or perhaps it was simply due to the fact that MGM just wasn\\'t that big anymore and it had left its best days behind them. Ever since the \\'50\\'s on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sort of had the reputation of making not too great and cheap movies, while in the early years before that it was really one of the biggest studios with lots of stars and acclaimed directors attached to it, who made many award winning classic movies. Luckily for them their reputation is starting to change again and whenever the MGM-logo appears at a movie people are no longer expecting a lesser-movie anymore.Anyway, even with its restrained budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this one. The movie is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplistic plot in it. The movie however still manages to capture you with its story and subjects, without ever starting to become preachy or anything about it. It makes the movie an effective one as well with its subjects.Really a movie that deserves to be seen.8/10\",pos\\r\\n\"I picked this DVD up for 3.99 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free. I never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the DVD player. The effects in this movie are horrible and cheap. Some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy. The acting is really cheesy in some parts, and the \"\"action\"\" scenes are completely laughable. You\\'ll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained. The plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to Los Angeles, there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot, not that there really is a plot at all.Don\\'t expect anything from this movie and don\\'t listen to the cover, there are not 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes.As for the DVD, there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film, a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train, and the deleted scenes are really pointless, if they weren\\'t good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad. There is also a really bad making of featurette which doesn\\'t really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots. I can\\'t recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends. I give it 2 kitty cats out of 5.\",neg\\r\\n\"Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I was not a fan of Vin diesel before I saw Pitch black, but after seeing Pitch Black my respect for Vin Diesel has gone up. He did a great job playing Riddick a man wanted for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, like near the end Riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don\\'t need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie, I think all the characters made this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10 ;)\",pos\\r\\nI have to agree with the previous author\\'s comments about the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident...(lazy Sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on)...and was mesmerized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (have always admired Martin Sheen) but was particularly impressed with Emilio! Excellent job of acting and directing...simply superb! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I\\'ll have to spread the news.,pos\\r\\n\"You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox in order to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at Fox.But the rule was broken here. Though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this film isn\\'t anywhere near as funny. In fact feminists would probably be aghast at it. In fact Barbara Stanwyck herself didn\\'t like it at all. She liked working with Henry Fonda right enough, but thought this film was ridiculous. As well she should have.Fonda is another millionaire playboy, who we would now call a trust fund baby who doesn\\'t really do much with his life. He\\'s sort of lovable lunkhead who meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off. Turns out she\\'s a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married. But it turns out Fonda has a jealous streak, especially when it involves Roger Clark, another millionaire patient of Stanwyck\\'s. And he\\'s not understanding as to her professional obligations.Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it, Fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store. She\\'s so proud of him, that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his salesman\\'s salary.Today NOW would be picketing the film. Stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance, probably because she didn\\'t believe any of it. I certainly couldn\\'t. I don\\'t think even back then audiences believed it either. But the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best, but this one was a Thanksgiving special.\",neg\\r\\n\"Where do I start? The box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt, but I\\'d been taught early on not to judge a book (or movie) by its cover, so I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can\\'t do a single still image properly, then how dismal will the moving ones be, later? Yeah. They were pretty awful.The actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed, as just any expression seemed to do fine, regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting to.However, a good story can offset the downfalls of low budget productions. Good dialog can carry a poorly-funded attempt at times. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times, as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinema.There simply aren\\'t words for how bad this was. Perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of -2.3/10 from...the Fiend :.\",neg\\r\\n\"I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is hilarious, but it has a heart as well.The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful, a piece of art come alive. So it was a diesel engine sub, so what? I learned that the Aircraft Carrier USS Ranger (which stood in for The Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was \\'conventionally powered\\', which might mean that Ranger was a diesel too.My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this can\\'s been on the stingray since Korea! This can expired in 1966! Buckman: (Takes finger full and tastes it) What\\'s the matter, sir? It still tastes like creamed corn.Pascal: (Yelling) Except, it\\'s DEVILED HAM!! Buckman: That would be a problem.It\\'s story, perhaps a wee strained, seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge, and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a battered but still seaworthy Balao-class sub, and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear Navy and \\'attack\\' Charlston Harbor, and Norfolk. 2-star Admiral Graham (with his eye on his third star, and a grudge against Dodge) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping that they would screw up so Dodge would lose. Can Tom Dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team, and can he take an old, out of date sub, and beat the Navy\\'s best?\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie was very good, not great but very good. It is based on a one man play by Ruben Santiago Hudson..yes he played most of the parts. On paper it looks like stunt casting. Yes let\\'s round up all the black folks in Hollywood and put them in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I didn\\'t see was Oprah\\'s ,thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie. Instead this movie was not some sentimental mess. It was moving but not phony, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer in question. The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny, Mrs Bill Crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people. Now being a jaded New Yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man, I\\'m thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going. Getting folks jobs and taking the medicare/caid checks But no she explains to Lou Gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time. I think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded New Yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks.(g) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal(g).. She almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes I can see why. She is married to a ne\\'er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her. Terrence Howard was born to play these type of parts. He was good but I would like to see him play something different. Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good. But for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this mans Oscar? He already won a Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. I did not even know who he was in this movie. He is a chameleon never the same. I never seen him play a bad part yet. This was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry. I re-winded the scene few times ..one time because I didn\\'t know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff. But she is so good here. I actually know people who act just like her. So it was very real to me Macy Grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good. I was very happy that they did not kill Nanny off. I thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People we might know or even lived with. Thank god for them, I do not know how they do it all of the time. I have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever I am feeling selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. THis movie is a tribute to all of those people. I only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man, Paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on HBO\\'s The Wire, Omar, Rosie Perez\\'s character and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindo\\'s one arm man, he was mesmerizing in another small role.\",pos\\r\\n\"Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending I get really angry about...lets just say its not my cup of tea, just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.The plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with. He goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.Well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. This is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief. I wouldn\\'t be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance, except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable. Why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this? It really ruined it for me.If you like romance give it a shot, though wait for cable.\",neg\\r\\nI really enjoyed this movie... In My DVD collection of baseball movies... Reminded me how great the sport truly is... Whether it\\'s here in America or Japan.,pos\\r\\n\"Usually I\\'m the one criticizing the twenty-something Neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic t*ts, gunfights and car chases. However, in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions. At least I wouldn\\'t have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels.I don\\'t mind surreal, and I certainly don\\'t mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning, but there should be some point to the whole thing. I didn\\'t get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were, instead, just so self-absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered. Or perhaps they just got confused themselves. Either way, I don\\'t care. It bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving grace.Although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited ravings about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography, I must respectfully disagree. Perhaps I didn\\'t mince through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals ...Or perhaps this movie was just crap. I give it a \"\"1\"\" and file it next to \"\"Ishtar.\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie starts out the way every movie should start out, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies and/or topless. A couple of them take showers. I\\'m liking it so far! Unfortunately, we then meet or main characters. They\\'re just not particularly likable. Usually in these movies, the actresses aren\\'t really acting, they give very \"\"natural\"\" performances, and they\\'re quite sympathetic, fun, and likable. Not here. They don\\'t have much of any personality and I didn\\'t care for them much.Some of the girls go on a camping trip for school. On the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang. The biker gang should really have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it\\'s just plain stupid. The head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them.I don\\'t really know what the heck happens after that. There\\'s a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it\\'s the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious Indian dude who keeps disappearing. Somebody gets eaten by a cheesy Lock Ness Monster thing as he\\'s swimming across a lake. Some guy in silly makeup is apparently a Druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world. Or maybe cause the end of the world, I\\'m afraid I wasn\\'t paying much attention. First he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie.It could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn\\'t even live up to my grade Z schlock expectations. They really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things. Instead it\\'s all over the place. Overall, if you\\'re looking for late \\'80 schlock, I imagine you could do worse. If you tried really hard. There\\'s plenty of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.\",neg\\r\\n\"Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier found by a girl from a Confederate boarding school and he\\'s taken in and nursed back to health instead of turned over to Confederate soldiers. Seems that the women-folk at this place have ulterior motives. Geraldine Paige, the headmistress, justifies not turning him into the Confederacy and even passes him off as her cousin. Of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the lady\\'s man and is pretty much making the rounds, but when he gets busted he REALLY gets busted, in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off, but it\\'s for his own good, of course, not out of retribution. Things get carried a bit further though when certain women don\\'t get what they want. I haven\\'t seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by today\\'s standards is still pretty strange. Not typical Eastwood at all. If you haven\\'t seen this one it\\'s worth seeing. 8 out of 10.\",pos\\r\\n\"Surface, from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. On one hand, it seemed so high-concept and plot driven that to the passerby it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture (or several). Plus, it felt like it was NBC\\'s attempt at a \"\"Lost-killer\"\". On the other hand, one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of Lost seemed intrigued.So, after one (and possibly only) season on NBC, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault, on Sci-fi, or filling a gap in NBC\\'s lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. Its ratings were some of the better on the network (which isn\\'t saying much), but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its future.So, is it worthwhile? Yes.Surface follows a continuing story format, driven by plot with next to no filler episodes. Almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot, much like a motion picture. No filler episodes, which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode. Yet, the show\\'s double-edge helped made up for that; Big things seem to happen every episode, but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and you\\'re left wanting more! That trait of the show, though shows how great it is. The cast is solid; the three main leads, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, put in a solid performance every episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding/studying the creatures. The supporting cast, including Ian Anthony Dale and the brief performance by Rade Serbedzija fill out the cast well. The story is slow to start (my one regret; it doesn\\'t really pick up until a 3-4 episodes in to the short 15-episode season), but the latter half of the season makes up for it. The visual effects are stunning (one\\'s jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures \\'attack\\' a ship), as well.Many of the show\\'s problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode.In short, if you\\'ve missed the first season and you\\'re curious, go back and watch it. It\\'s no Twin Peaks in terms of quirkiness, but the high-concept nature of it puts in in league with that, Lost, and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. Enjoy it.\",pos\\r\\n\"Well, I tend to watch films for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this film, so I can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women (read girls)Yes, it is funny, I know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout. Personally though, I loved it for Laura Fraser, who IMHO is FIT!\",pos\\r\\n\"Mercy the movie, actually starts out as a somewhat decent film, and ellen barkin does give a strong performance. But if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare. It is always hard to brink a book onto film and unfortunatley this one ends up failing...... 3 out of 10\",neg\\r\\n\"\"\"you can\\'t take it realistically.\"\" -sheetsZombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world all of its own. I\\'ve really never seen anything like it. The only thing I can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich\\xc3\\xa9\\xc2\\x97I don\\'t simply mean that it\\'s incoherent and absurd, though occasionally it is. I mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you, and when it\\'s over, you find that it\\'s all happened while you were sitting on the couch.It is worth noting that it\\'s extremely low-budget, as a disclaimer to those who, after seeing \"\"Shaun of the Dead,\"\" consider themselves fans of underground zombie films. Also of note is that it is much more \"\"brutal\"\" than you\\'d expect. Children get disemboweled, and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin. Her corpse is subsequently \"\"raped.\"\" These are certainly not flaws, and indeed I feel it is to the film\\'s credit. But if it doesn\\'t sound like your kind of movie, don\\'t waste your time.(I don\\'t mean to over-hype it, regarding brutality. Don\\'t go in expecting \"\"Inside\"\" or something.) I hesitate to give away any of the plot, because it\\'s really full of surprises. Even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is at once a classic horror scene and something quite original.Man, I\\'m three paragraphs in and I\\'ve hardly said anything at all. Here\\'s why I thought the movie was awesome: 1. It\\'s big, and it keeps moving. At one point, you expect it to turn into another NotLD clone, a board-up-the-windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another. By the end of the film, however, the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream. There are also a number of outdoor, urban scenes. These are rare in low-budget zombie films.2. The makeup/gore is much better than ZB1. More convincing and more creative. Something kind of funny: the early zombies look really lame. Then, halfway through, they suddenly look really good, with prosthetics and everything. Some of them look like Fulci zombies, some are reminiscent of Mr. Tongue from \"\"Day of the Dead.\"\" And it\\'s got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around. Never gets old.3. There\\'s something oddly emotional about it. One character asserts that heaven exists, and that our dead/undead protagonists are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe it to be true. Though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity, they genuinely seem to care about each other, and accordingly, I found myself caring about them.4. The pacing is great. There\\'s hardly a dull moment.My only observation that borders on criticism is that Todd Sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog I\\'ve ever heard. I personally feel it adds to the experience, but I don\\'t think he does it on purpose, so I can\\'t fairly give the film a perfect rating. (Example: when a car breaks down, the owner yells at the passengers. Then he says something to the effect of, \"\"Sorry I yelled at you guys. You don\\'t know what it\\'s like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you\\'re five years old.\"\" wtf?) At the very end, it gets to be more than I can handle. Involves a montage with Bill Clinton, and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor. Really, by this point, I was firmly re-living my drug experiences.Highly recommended. 7/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"Broadcast News {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} ****/**** Although it lacks the emotional punch of Brooks\\'s debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is a superlative film, with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well-researched as a hard-hitting news report. Let it be known, this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second. In my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. The film\\'s characters are given surprising depth and dimension , while the satire remains sly and never bitter. Comparisons to Network are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes. While also a great film, Network is a cynical and weary work; in other words, its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television. Network\\'s style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters populating the news rooms of Broadcast News love and live for their jobs (sometimes to the detriment of their love lives.) They derive pleasure from the stresses and satisfactions of news reporting, just as the audience derives pleasure from watching this sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece.\",pos\\r\\n\"Without doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of \"\"AAA\"\" level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun, \"\"G\"\" rated family adventure. This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the \"\"GRAND CHAMPION\"\" cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose on-camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt, JULIA. You can expect a lot from this young Roberts-prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9\\' as is already proving itself in her new, hit Nickelodeon series, \"\"UNFABULOUS.\"\"\",pos\\r\\n\"William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn\\'t take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother. He surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he wants to enlist also at 10 years old. Ron Perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy. This short film won an Oscar for Best Short-Live Action film which is well-deserved. If it was longer, it could compete with the longer films. Everything else like costumes, art direction, and recreating the era of America in 1941 is perfect. The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most Americans were surviving the great depression. The actors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances. If Hollywood would make more quality films, I would probably go to the cinema more. If Broadway had more quality shows, I would go to the theater more.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.The story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. Moreover, the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. Not only do they all happen to be good actors, Jia Hongsheng\\'s parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards Jia are very effective.Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action films late eighties start nineties. Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River. In between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.I like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs. We really feel the pain and struggle Jia is in. At the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him.The film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern Jia seems to be caught in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him. Because there are personal \\'interviews\\' with the characters we feel like we are getting to know Jia not only through himself but through others as well.The film has a heavy feel, but scenes of Jia cycling through Bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone. So does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. This is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern Chinese film this is a strong recommendation.\",pos\\r\\n\"Honestly, at first, I watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes I heard it possesses but by actually watching the film, it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there. Truly, it is one of the most well-crafted and touching movies I\\'ve ever watched. I\\'m a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. It gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who I am. Cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heart-warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it. It made the movie more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain but I don\\'t agree myself. Brokeback Mountain has more drama while Latter Days is well-balanced.\",pos\\r\\n\"I was very curious to see this Wajda-Depardieu outing, plus the time period is definitely fascinating. Being a Wajda fan, I was disappointed, and that may be an understatement. The film never really took cinematic flight -- there\\'s no foundation for the animosity between Danton and Robespierre, etc.Basically, the script was weak (adapted from \"\"The Danton Affair\"\"). And yet, the direction was masterful...it\\'s Wajda, afterall! Also, there were some amazing actors BUT they never really grab the audience\\'s attention like they should. Depardieu comes off as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant Danton...not exactly the image we have in mind. Woijech Pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can\\'t break down. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda pop up ... as Bourdon and Saint-Just...and if you\\'re familiar with Wajda, then you\\'d know them.Overall, I was disappointed with this much-lauded film. Great cast, great director, but no quality foundation. Bad, undynamic script. We need to get in Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre\\'s (General J) mindsets... what are their motivations? Eh...who knows? One likes women, the other powders himself? Riiight. Ok, so if you\\'re looking for a great French Revolution movie I HIGHLY recommend \"\"La Revolution Francaise\"\"...it\\'s in two parts and oh-so-great! Excellent performances, in-depth script, juicy tid bits...definitely a satisfying experience!! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieu...the wonderful Andrzej Seweryn apparently took some notes from \"\"Danton\"\" and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre. SEE IT! NOW! As for Wajda fans -- you\\'re better off with \"\"Man of Iron/Marble\"\", \"\"Promised Land\"\", and the like. Cheers!!\",pos\\r\\n\"Totally brain-dead actioner made in the Philippines. This belongs to the mode of Filipino movies which tried to pass themselves as American films on the international market. After a rather dull beginning, the movie takes off and never disappoints again. It is actually a rip-off of the worst movies Chuck Norris ever made : an American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by the soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the Pope, then the President of the USA. One of his old buddies (played by B-movie stalwart Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Utterly ridiculous action scenes, putrid acting (Nick Nicholson\\'s performance as the evil soviet commander is a must-see!)and implausible plot make up for one of the cheesiest action pictures ever bestowed in the general public.\",neg\\r\\n\"It is a shame that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate has pulled this great movie from the viewing, thereby depriving the public from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into one motion picture. It is also true that the singing voices for Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge were dubbed for this movie, and that is used as one of the reasons that the Gershwin\\'s do not want this movie ever released again.For in spite the flaws in the movie and the creative differences between the Gershwins and the Goldwyns, this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever committed to the screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey are especially deserving praise.This film was the great independent producer Samuel Golwyn\\'s swan song. It was also ironically, the Gershwin\\'s greatest shame.Finally, it is a loss to the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. For we can no longer see them at their best.\",pos\\r\\nWow! What a movie if you want to blow your budget on the title and have it look real bad ask the guys that made this movie on how to do that. They could have spent the money on a good rewrite or something else.

The film starts off reasonably well but nothing is elucidated and at the end we are no farther forward than in the beginning. As to seeing the husband for the murder of his wife, this is just not plausible. You need tangible proof to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case there is none at all so it just is not plausible. Remember the old adage \"\"innocent until proved guilty\"\". The fact that a woman has disappeared without trace is no proof that her husband killed her. So I really don\\'t know what kind of point this film was trying to make. The outcome is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the spectator. So quite frankly, viewing it is a complete waste of time. After all, a film must be entertaining .... this is completely untrue in the case of this one and I suggest it be irrevocably consigned to the dustbin where it belongs !\",neg\\r\\n\"They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the \\'gendercide\\' of men. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.OK, the plot. Some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. So then all the men are killed or something. So there are no more.Then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can\\'t be violent. The male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man. Not long after, he takes the blonde\\'s\\' Volkswagen beetle and drives into the city where he\\'s discovered. Now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever but no way. The police chase him.I didn\\'t watch the rest but it probably ends up that they\\'ve got to race against the clock and some people, or something bad will probably happen. Somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion. These brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how they\\'d single handedly get rid of a planet full of women, but I didn\\'t watch. And neither should you.If you\\'re up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on, don\\'t watch. Watch anything but this. You\\'ll find those ads for Bowflex or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to \\'pick up the phone to meet women just like these\\' in your area will be more satisfying entertainment.(Oh yeah, there\\'s this funny thing when they\\'re pulling in with their cars. I don\\'t know what they did, it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird.) The blonde girl was kind of cute and I\\'m feeling generous, so... 2/10.\",neg\\r\\n\"Pick a stereotype, any stereotype (whether racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you\\'ll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think that all Hispanic teenage boys are stupid, hairy, inarticulate, and dirty troublemakers? Are Hispanic girls sex-crazed, easy, ass-baring sluts? Do Black people all want to start fights and carry guns? Do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them? Are all White teenage girls rich, stuck-up princesses who are bored with White teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered \"\"yes\"\" to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a bigot, and you will LOVE Wassup Rockers.Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audiences (I was 15 years old the first time I saw Kids and I think that\\'s why I\\'m still a virgin), but Wassup Rockers isn\\'t shocking\\xc2\\x85 it\\'s just bad. He tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body-hair close-ups, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic.Simply put, Wassup Rockers is a teenage boy\\'s fantasy. What 14-year-old boy doesn\\'t want to be a skater who gets in trouble, crashes parties, drinks 40s, and is told by the hot, rich, White girl that his uncircumcised penis \"\"looks dangerous?\"\" Besides that demographic, I really don\\'t know who\\'s going to enjoy this film.\",neg\\r\\n\"After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew, but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won\\'t allow them to live in peace.The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that\\'s a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise, I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential. Unfortunately, the film didn\\'t live up to its potential although I should have expected this since the trailer was awful. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and bland dialog. The characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them.The directors did a horrible job at building up suspense. They mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps. The music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next \"\"scary\"\" moment. I also didn\\'t like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and that\\'s where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area. Also, I didn\\'t like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation, the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying. The directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish. However, since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it\\'s not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a Hollywood film.The acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in December, I\\'m sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in Panic Room but you wouldn\\'t be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in The Messengers. She was okay at acting scared and that\\'s it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions I have ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors. Overall, this lame horror film is not worth watching because of it\\'s blandness and lazy film-making. Rating 4/10\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they are interesting.

It only had about 3 minutes of actual entertainment, the rest of it was just a total bore. The acting isn\\'t that great and the action scenes are soooo cheesy it\\'s not even funny. I kinda wish I could say something good about this film but I can\\'t think of anything right now. There probably was somethings in it some can enjoy but the ending of it is gotta be the dumbest idea ever. What type of person would get a little toy remote controlled helicopter with a burned in machine gun in it to assassinate the President? This idea could have never been done in the first place let alone have anyone dumb enough to try it, I guess the writer must have been to obsessed with the toy car scene in The Dead Pool but actually tried to make this look serious.\",neg\\r\\n\"I think Homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie - more like \"\"Plantation Grown\"\" - but it doesn\\'t have quite the same ring to it. My guide described it a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh. More in the genre of the farcical thriller/drama. The characters developed well enough - an all-star cast made it oh-so promising, just a shame the plot was patently absurd. Ted Danson provided a fine cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walk-on part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one - not for the gun shy paranoid types though.\",neg\\r\\n\"Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli. This movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. Fast times was more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. Someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life. The film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits Michelle schocked in the liquor store or Ben Stein in his first role in the sunny\\'s surplus store.\",pos\\r\\n\"It is playing on SHOWTIME right now but is going to be released as a movie called THREE or has been released for 2006.

And of course what would a movie be without sex. The lady has a nice body and the men are pretty, but the story is the same as Swept Away or A Savage is Loose type with some blood. Wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and already released this show and now gonna release it as THREE. Billy Zane should have worn a top hair piece or shaved his head completely.

Well I find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its \"\"only TV\"\". But of course it isn\\'t only TV is it? The possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the United States is certainly within the range of plausibility.

Back in the beginning, in that late \\'30s and early \\'40s heyday when Disney was serving cinematic banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite releasing two very commendable films, they never quite cornered the market \\xc2\\x96 many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of Mr Bug Goes To Town, released the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbour (which gave the American public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon!)

Humans use the land as a shortcut, discarding litter and cigars, and other hazards, right on top of the bugs\\' homes as they go. Honey-shop owner Mr Bumble (voiced by Jack Mercer) fears that the future is bleak, and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter Honey (voiced by Pauline Loth) in more secure surroundings. A highly unscrupulous creature, Bagley C.

Hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better, but is left looking foolish when Bagley Beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end. Only at the very end, as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper, do the bugs switch loyalty back to Hoppity as they look to him to lead them a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of humans.What really works in this film is the delightful characterisation \\xc2\\x96 all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. The bumbling villains Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. Equally admirable is the storytelling drive \\xc2\\x96 even the youngest of children can enjoy this story, while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife. Time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and when viewing it the audience needs to accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general age and wear. But on the whole Mr Bug Goes To Town is an accomplished, funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot.\",pos\\r\\n\"Snake Island is one of those films that, whilst one sits and watches its amazing level of stupidity, makes one wish the film camera had never been invented. The real reason why Plan 9 From Outer Space will hold onto its honoured title of Worst Film Of All Time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is. It is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining bad film you will ever see. Snake Island is the other kind of bad. Snake Island is just so bad that it is excruciating. A stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys tapping one-key typewriters onto transparencies that were then overlapped in order to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. Filmed entirely on location in South Africa, the environments in which the film takes place are about the only element that can truthfully be considered well-realised. Many shots involving snakes consist of close-ups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are CGI, puppets, or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugs.William Katt stars, if you can call it that, as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry. Coming along with him is an assortment of very generic, poorly-defined characters. It is all a matter of random screen writing as to who survives to the end, but Katt certainly appears to be contemplating firing his agent. The rest of the cast seem to be from the Home And Away acting school, where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by open-mouthed gaping and darting one\\'s eyes about in every direction. The foley effects are often worse, with one memorable scene where a double-barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany gunshots in such games as BioForge. Meanwhile, snakes continually explode or jump about at random. It would have been more accurate to call the film Snake Holocaust.Of course, no Z-grade horror or sci-fi film is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undress. As every woman in the cast, almost, gets their clothes off, the film starts to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst piles, all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff. The sex scenes never eventuate, and the deaths of characters are so flat, so uninteresting, that the entire film becomes pointless. Unless you consider watching William Katt running through a muggy forest wearing ill-fitting cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat a payoff. For the record, I don\\'t. I used to think that Anaconda was the worst film ever made about predatory snakes. I was so very, very wrong. At least Anaconda had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time. Some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the shoelaces from some pairs of combat boots I have worn.So we so far have the checklist for bad horror films running along nicely. The unrecognisable, lame cast are accounted for, as are poor audio and visual effects. The dialogue is so wretched, so ill-timed, that I have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays I have acted in many moons ago. Unfortunately, where Snake Island falters in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films. In essence, it forgets to be so bad that it is funny. It is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak. Compared to William Katt\\'s performance in Snake Island, Jon Voight\\'s performance in Anaconda was as Oscar-worthy as Russell Crowe\\'s in Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt are necessarily bad actors, but with material like this, you\\'re hard-pressed to say a single word naturally. Listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. One\\'s mind tends to blank out the experience, primary as a self-defense mechanism.Because of the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad, I gave Snake Island a two out of ten. My special score for films that are so bad they cannot possibly be good, but not bad enough to entertain. It is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern.

I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those to whom this \"\"shocking vanguard of cinematic expression\"\" would appeal. But I found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade. Except we never had a real cow.Having heard endless sermons from beard-stroking art connaisseurs of how this is such an important film, I thought it would be worth my time. Make no mistake, this is crap. If I hear one more person call Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel the \"\"father of cinematic Surrealism\"\", I think I\\'m going to punch someone. If anything, he issued a major step backward from the Surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) 10 years earlier. This made a joke out of the whole thing, as if Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel didn\\'t have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm, sans l\\'absurdit\\xc3\\xa9. It would take Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel another 40 years before he would refine his style into something admirable. Skip the early stuff and hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work.I\\'m sure he would agree. In 1977, Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies. In this case I would be happy to pour the lighter fluid.\",neg\\r\\n\"Fear and Desire is of interest mainly to Kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. Kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. He considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. This is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than \"\"Barry Lyndon\"\"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest, and has its genuine absorbing moments. It\\'s a difficult film to find (only \"\"unofficial\"\" copies are in circulation), though perhaps this may change if Kubrick\\'s estate relents and has it released on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.\",neg\\r\\n\"Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. It\\'s editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen.The music really tied into the story, which made the characters come to life. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, most notably S. Epatha Merkerson\\'s.I can\\'t wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.\",pos\\r\\n\"In Russia, the ordinary teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) lives a leisured life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother, without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator. Her brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, being always motive for arguing. When Vera meets the student of university Sergei (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love for each other and decide to get married. Sergei moves to Vera\\'s house, but lives in conflict with her father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy.I have just seen \"\"Malenkaya Vera\"\", and I liked a lot this deep family drama. I am not familiarized with the life style in the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first one, when Victor tells Vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. Another one, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. Many difficulties of Vera\\'s family and their friends, the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in Third World countries. This low budget movie is very well-directed, and the story is very profound and real. The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. In the cover of the Brazilian VHS, released by Sagres distributor, there is information that Natalya Negoda was the centerfold of Playboy magazine. I am not sure how precise are the subtitles in Portuguese, since many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to short translation in few words. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"\"A Pequena Vera\"\" (\"\"The Little Vera\"\")\",pos\\r\\n\"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal dentures, bites people on the neck, and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms. He also thinks he\\'s a chicken.Sounds bizarre right? Well, to me, the more bizarre and weird the person is, the better. The more gore, the better and so on.The movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck. He also clucks like a chicken and THINKS he\\'s a chicken.If I had a patient like this, there is no way I would release him.First, Luther heads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away. Then, he sneaks in the back seat of a woman\\'s car and she drives all the way to her home.While at the house, Luther ties up the woman to the bed. When the woman\\'s daughter and her daughter\\'s boyfriend come home, Luther hides.Later through the film, a cop comes to the front door and asks about the mother. You can clearly see the daughter is scared out of her mind and crying but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay. She replies that everything is fine. The officer finally gets in his car and leaves. If I saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared, I would want to at least get inside the house to investigate a little.The ending is stupid as well. While the woman in in the barn, she starts clucking and gets Luther excited so he starts walking around flapping his arms and clucking like a maniac. She finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally clucking some more.Then the credits roll.This is one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen! NOTHING happens at the woman\\'s house! NOTHING!I sometimes like campy films but this one really bored me.I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Good idea, bad direction!\",neg\\r\\n\"After a string of successful \\'a man and his monkey films\\', which included the seminal \"\"Every Which Way But Loose\"\", \"\"Every Which Way You Can\"\" and \"\"Peter\\'s Friends\"\", the genre fell on hard times. In an effort to rejuvenate this once celebrated area, director Frank Marshall brought Michael Crichton\\'s acclaimed novel to the big screen.Think \\'Gorillas in the Mist\\' meets \\'Tron\\' minus the box-office clout of Bruce Boxleitner. This is one mans doomed love affair for his talking monkey. Not helped by bad accents (Tim Curry struggles with a Romanian), a baboon of a screenplay, hungry hippos, skydiving primates and Bruce Campbell. Ape-Sh*t.\",neg\\r\\n\"OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Where\\'s originality? Why remake a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the first time? Why remake such a movie to begin with? If you ARE going to remake something, remake something that doesn\\'t work and make it BETTER!Second, they used the exact same script from the 1960 version. The dialog no longer works. It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn\\'t write the script, you could have rewritten. This film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing John Anderson\\'s performance as the car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie. Vince Vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than Anthony Perkins, but in doing so, you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate while watching Marion undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen\\'s accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was far too old to play Caroline. Her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock\\'s performance. The only good thing I saw about the film was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the movie with the shot Hitch had envisioned. Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over Phoenix but couldn\\'t at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots cross-dissolved together. This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel. After that, though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film, watch this, but do NOT under any circumstances watch this BEFORE you watch the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been green-lit. Stick to the master\\'s film, not the imitation.\",neg\\r\\n\"I don\\'t understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it\\'s not even a real movie! It was unbelievable, me and a group of friends decided to watch this one night and it was just the stupidest thing any of us had ever seen, I couldn\\'t believe it! We watched the first 15 minutes in utter awe that somebody actually thought of this and then made it into a movie. Are they on crack? My guess is yes, in huge doses. I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash. Is this supposed to be sci-fi or comedy or what? I don\\'t thing the idiots who made this even care, they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many suckers they could trick into watching it. Well, we put something on film so let\\'s take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf--no, no, no. This is not movie-making. The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that\\'s how bad it is. I feel like going to the movie store and complaining and getting my money back, nobody should have to endure this crap. So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie was a modern day scarface.It had me on my toes.This movie is one of those rare epic films that makes you want a sequel.I especially liked Damian Chapa his performance deserved an academy award,which he deserved for his performance in blood in blood out.The only thing I didn\\'t like was the behind the scenes because it didn\\'t show the intensity that the movie had,and i would have like to have seen less narrated scenes.But the movie was great and it is in my top ten movies of all time.Plus the acting was great there wasn\\'t a bad scene in the movie,I loved it ,Jennifer Tilly was perfect as well as all of the cast.I can\\'t see how anyone wouldn\\'t like this movie it was a great.Definitely a must see.\",pos\\r\\n\"This may contain ***SPOILERS***Where to start on this particular empty wasteland? Well it would have been nice if they actually had a plot. Acting talent, decent dialog, suspense, humor, hey even gratuitous sex would have helped this flick. Unfortunately there was only a lot of gore, (even that wasn\\'t done well), shooting automatic weapons and missing.There seemed to be no reason to attach the basic premise, a Native American cursed to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered, with his being tracked down by a Federal Special Ops team who dressed in civvies(?). Most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a Horror movie, separating from the group so you can be picked off one by one. You\\'d think this team would know better, especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappearing without a trace. When they finally realize they\\'re being picked off they make one of several stands and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a whole lot. Tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money.When they\\'re not shooting trees they\\'re tracking this spirit who leaves no trail, (who knows how they\\'re tracking it), and spouting a lot of macho BS. By the way, did I mention that most of this team are women? Interesting listening to them talk tough. Not very entertaining, but interesting.All in all, You can find better movies in the bargain bin at Kmart.\",neg\\r\\n\"I saw this on TCM recently and, through the IMDb I found that there were seven \"\"Crime Doctor\"\" movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist-detective. Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier. Not noir, and a bit campy today, the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural. The plot, black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances by a number of B movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately (none ever made it to the A status). It is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes.I would love to see a boxed DVD series of these films.\",pos\\r\\n\"Steve Martin looks like he\\'s had a face lift. Something very strange about his face.

Recognizing Jennifer Lynch\\'s name and seeing the 18 certificate I realised it might be disturbing. In actuality I found the film a farce. I found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it. The acting is atrocious- Bill Pullman and his ridiculous twitching face. I do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction. After some shocking incident, (there is plenty to \"\"try\"\" and shock the viewer in this film), 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything was overstated, or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious! The performance from the little girl character named Stephanie was the best thing about the film. Quiet and intense. I really could not recommend this film to anyone. Its violent without point, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and plain silly.\",neg\\r\\n\"My god...i have not seen such an awful movie in a long...long time...saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes...keira knightley tries really really hard in this one, but she cant handle it..dropped her accent every once in a while and didn\\'t have the charisma to fill the role...sienna millers acting gets you to a point where you start to ask yourself: Has she ever had acting lessons? judging by the edge of love shes never been to acting class, but should consider to go in the near future...they both look really pretty..maybe thats what they should focus on in their future career..if they can be actresses everybody can!\",neg\\r\\n\"First of all, let me make it clear. This movie is a real piece of garbage, but although it is a real piece of garbage, it is an better piece of garbage than it could have been. It could have sucked big-time, but it doesn\\'t...What this movie didn\\'t have, was for example scary moments, good acting and a good script. It wasn\\'t very entertaining either. But the movie had cool music, fancy locations and hot girls. It also works great as a Dracula spoof. (hope it was meant that way, although I really don\\'t think so)The story focuses on three girls in Transylvania, awaking an ancient vampire, which then terrorizes and kills the girls, one by one. Sounds familiar? Yes, so it does!After reading through this, you may think that I should have given it a better vote. The reason I don\\'t, is because I almost felt asleep at some points...\",neg\\r\\n\"I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off. Knowing this was a blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be low budget... the acting sub-par... but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout. If there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal... or perhaps overacting. As an actor and filmmaker, I cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances. Yet, I must admit, I could not look away. I don\\'t know if this was like a car wreck you can\\'t turn your eyes from, or some mysterious power in the film that kept me there. This film is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong. If Walter Kronkite were to tell \"\"the Aristocrats\"\" joke, it would be a total flop, although the joke itself is hilarious. Let Dave Chappelle tell it, and we are all rolling on the floor laughing. This film needed a \"\"Chapelle.\"\" Now, with that said, if you have the opportunity to purchase this film for the dollar that I did, do it. It is well worth the money. Perhaps I will take another dollar, purchase the rights to this film, and remake it. Who knows... it might not be any better, but it surely can\\'t be any worse.\",neg\\r\\n\"This may not be the most exiting or incredible episode they\\'ve made, but in my opinion it remains as one of Star Trek and the Sci-Fi genre\\'s most original episodes. Most ideas from retro Sci-Fi series especially including Star Trek has been reused several times, this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph. This among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the end.Another thing I like with this episode is how it has accomplished to create such and exiting and captivating story with such few special affects. Now without criticizing the episode I must admit the effects are very dated, but then again what can you expect from a TV show from 1967? But still the creature (\"\"Horta\"\") in this episode is basically just a carpet with some coloured rubber on it. Yet you forget this after about 1 minute and you only start thinking about it as what it\\'s supposed to be. Also the caves don\\'t exactly look like rock, but again you forget it after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof on how good acting and a good story, can make you ignore the visual effects.The acting from the main cast is as usual great. This episode features the series second mind meld by Spock and is one of my favourites. So to say it simple Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene stealer here, and his acting is excellent. Not that Kirk or Bones don\\'t get their share of the episode but Spock is the most intriguing in this one. i like the fact that the episode is not about one specific character but evolves around the trio handling an alien problem. Also it\\'s nice to see an episode who doesn\\'t only happen on the Enterprise.Like most Star Trek episodes this episode tells us to have an open mind. I won\\'t spoil the story, but evolves around what in the start seems like a typical monster story. It has killed several humans and therefore must be killed. But is that really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation in the end, will not disappoint you. This is still my favourite Star Trek TOS episode and i give it a 10/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"I am probably a little too old for this movie, 16, and being a guy, the story is a little too girlie, but I really thought it was a cool movie overall. All the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses, from Alana, to Adrianne, to Deena, to Kimberly, all the way down to the cute girl that plays Alana\\'s little sister, Rachel. I am not a huge pop-star fan with the lovesick songs, but I thought that Aaron Carter did a really great job in this, and seems like he was really into this movie, and made it seem real. My mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with, so that\\'s cool too. I kept thinking that I liked a lot of the people, and wonder if I will see them again? A sequel would be cool. I rented this, but I might buy it too, since I have a ton of DVD\\'s, and like to go back to see something that I missed. I couldn\\'t buy it at Blockbuster though, so I don\\'t know where I could buy it right now, but I\\'ll look into that. Anyway, I am a 16 year old guy, I already said that, I know, but I would totally take a date to see this. It\\'s really good for all ages, really. I think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this. That\\'s what is so cool about it, that it is something that all ages can see. I\\'m sure that was done on purpose, but it really works. Girls can dream about being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie. There is something for everyone.\",pos\\r\\n\"The Bone Collector is set in New York City & starts as one of the world\\'s foremost criminologist\\'s & crime scene experts Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. Jump forward four years & Alan (Gary Swanson) & his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after New York cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of Alan. Amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses Rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of Lindsay. Having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for Rhyme & the police...Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night & I have to say it\\'s one of the worst big budget post The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & Se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers I have seen, in fact it makes Friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin. For a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. The character\\'s are truly awful & I didn\\'t believe any of them were actual human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there\\'s just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can\\'t do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. He is seemingly impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, I\\'m not being funny here but wouldn\\'t any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there\\'s Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police Captain? Then there\\'s the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, I could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target Rhyme anything else. Also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! How did that happen? I should also mention Amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo\\'s & shoots rats for no apparent reason.Besides some of the worst written character\\'s ever the story & plot isn\\'t much better We never find out why the killer is using The Bone Collector book as inspiration We never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. It\\'s never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. There is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. Also the killers clues are a little obscure aren\\'t they? I mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? Logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of New York to choose from? There\\'s some nonsense about a bird that sits on Rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours The Bone Collector is really slow going. There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it\\'s atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.With a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 The Bone Collector is well made with good production values & that Hollywood gloss about it. I also must add right now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen, I think she is absolutely terrible in this. Denzel Washington just sort of lies there really, Queen Latifah is awful & even Michael Rooker can\\'t do much as he is stuck with a clich\\xc3\\xa9d & one dimensional character.The Bone Collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood films I have seen in a while, I saw it for free on telly last night & I still feel cheated & ripped-off. There are just so many things to poke holes at it\\'s silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? Works either way to be honest...\",neg\\r\\n\"At least for me. I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was not crazy about this film. I think Penelope Cruz was miscast, the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good, she makes the character unbelievable. Also, the singing scene was just weird. I do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful.As Spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts are the accents. Why people coming from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense. And the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? I found myself trying to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are \"\"old school\"\", things are not like that anymore.I was expecting more but this time Mr.Almodovar did not deliver, at least for me. I am not saying that Miss Cruz does a bad job, I am saying that she does not belong there, not portraying that character.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie is TRASH from the word go. First, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 YEARS AGO! Who cares? This movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap. It makes a complex person like Bob Knight into a cartoon character.Swearing doesn\\'t bother me, but I\\'m still amazed that ESPN showed a movie with more cursing than a Kevin Smith movie on a basic cable channel. The F-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break.This movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed. I rate this on the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge and Everybody Wins...2 movies that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I\\'ve seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80\\'s South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it\\'s depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the \"\"certain\"\" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It\\'s strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today. The violence is well done as to show the severity of Gerrit\\'s crimes and greatness of his transformation.One word about Jan Ellis who played Gerrit Wolfaardt. He carries you through the darkness of Gerrit\\'s beginnings to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark places as an actor and is to be commended on his performance.Another standout performance was that of Mpho Lovinga who plays Moses Moremi, one victim of Gerrit\\'s crimes. He was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance.Very good movie to show the teens.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is hilarious. The laughs never stop. Every scene is packed to the limit with hilarious comedy. Chris Farley is a comic genius, and Spade plays his character to a tee. Farley was one of the best slap stick comics ever, and in this movie(as with all his movies) we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character the way he saw fit. \"\"Tommy Boy\"\" is an excellent example of a comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I have seen it before.\",pos\\r\\n\"One of the greatest crimes made against Sci-fi television was the cancellation of Farscape. One of the most well-written, well-acted and over-all best shows ever to grace the airwaves, it set new standards for Sci-fi television. Once the flagship, highest rated, critically acclaied show of the Sci-Fi Channel, it defies explaination as to why shows like Buffy, Tremors: The Series, and even StarGate: SG-1 have lasted as long as they have. Yes, even Buffy. But I\\'ll save my Buffy bashing for another time. Farscape was poorly treated by the Sci-Fi channel, continually tossed around in scheduling, reruns rarely shown and never really advertised. But while the show has been cancelled, all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back (even Henson Company CEO Brian Henson). There is also an extensive fan-based movement to bring the show back . Overall things are looking far from dark, and hopefully, fans will get their season 5.\",pos\\r\\n\"Doug McClure has starred in a few of these British produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot . I know THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values . That\\'s the problem with this movie - The production values go way beyond \"\" So bad they\\'re good \"\" affectionate territory and become \"\" so bad I think I\\'ll go and see what\\'s on the other channels \"\" One case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid Cushing and McClure encountering a monster . It\\'s painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection . It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot . Have I mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces ? No really this looks like it was filmed in somebody\\'s living room with the spare change left over from that year\\'s DOCTOR WHO budget . Even former DOCTOR WHO Peter Cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line \"\" You can\\'t mesmerise me - I\\'m British \"\" is delivered in a very flat way ( A very similar line is spoken by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS ) in a script devoid of characterisation , plotting and memorable dialogue . It\\'s not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable it\\'s also infrequent and rare since the monsters don\\'t speak . Wouldn\\'t it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so that they could explain the plot . Does anyone here know what the plot actually is ? A very tedious British movie that even the twin talents of Caroline Munro can not save . The whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops\",neg\\r\\n\"A very hyped-up, slick, edgy reinterpretation.They\\'ve fallen into the \"\"because it\\'s modern, it has to be hyped-up, slick, etc.\"\" trap.\"\"Romeo and Juliet\"\" carried this idea off much more successfully, but I really think it\\'s time we move beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. edgy film).Just because this is a \"\"modern\"\" retelling, doesn\\'t mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad, or have anything to do with drugs or guns.If the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words, Macbeth would be a far more powerful film. As it is, read your Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask your Oxford dictionary some questions. Skip the film. Or don\\'t, but you\\'ve been warned.Sorry for the super-long review. IMDb made me do it.\",neg\\r\\n\"Every time I think about this film I feel physically ill. To read such a great book and later discover there\\'s a film of it was a great feeling. Years later and imagine my joy at switching on the sci-fi channel and finding it starts in just 5mins!!! Up go the titles and then uggg. If just a couple of things had changed OK. Everything is changed. Numerous characters are removed entirely new rubbish ones are added. The main hero is shrunk and de-aged by about 30 years, and hilariously his girlfriend/wife is now his mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie capabilities. This is truly appalling cinema at its absolute worst. I would quite happily remove my own toenails with pliers rather than sit through another horrific viewing, and I urge anyone thinking of watching this - please don\\'t. If you own a copy burn it now, right now and think how much better your life would have been had this celluloid insult never occurred.\",neg\\r\\n\"In Pasadena, Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) sends her daughter Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to Tokyo to bring her sister Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire, back to the USA. After their meeting, Karen dies and Aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets herself cursed in the same situation, being chased by the ghost of the house. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the three high school mates Allison (Arielle Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with his children, the teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight). On the next door, weird things happen with their neighbor.\"\"The Grudge 2\"\" has scary sound and visual effects, with the creepy woman and boy, and I have startled a couple of times while watching this movie. However, the complex screenplay with three subplots is totally confused, making the entwined story a complete mess. There are too much characters and situations, and in a certain moment I was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative. In the end, I was completely disappointed with this confused, but also spooky film. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): \"\"O Grito 2\"\" (\"\"The Scream 2\"\")\",neg\\r\\n\"Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie. When Ray Charles was little, he went blind and his mother didn\\'t baby him. She was a strong woman who didn\\'t treat him any different because he was blind. She made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life. His mother also sent him to school as well. Then when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics, sex and betrayal. When I am discouraged about something I can just think of this movie and it will inspire me.\",pos\\r\\n\"I was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world. A hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world. For the most part the Hispanic culture is shown as I have always observed and admired - hardworking, optimistic, and truly family oriented. The points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the Catholic church. Without a doubt,the actress who played the mother deserves an Academy Award. Her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears. I will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'m a massive fan of prison dramas which is reflected in OZ being my all time favourite American TV show . I guess the appeal lies in a type of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen to bad mens\\' bottoms , but I found Don Siegel\\'s RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 to be rather disappointing . Okay I knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language , graphic shankings and gang rape but even so it\\'s a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT . The problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader Dunn being something of a prison reformer . Yeah that sounds ridiculous since he\\'s a violent anti hero rather than some limp wristed tree hugging do gooder on a salary , but that\\'s what he is in essence , he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to rejoin society rather than being made to suffer . There\\'s also a problem of making a B movie with such radical themes ( Quite ironic that Siegel would later make DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal is a dead one ) and that is the cast isn\\'t very good with Emile Meyer as the warder being especially irritating in his performance . like i said a disappointing movie\",neg\\r\\n\"This is so blatantly a made-for-TV ripoff of Black Widow (1987) - even the insect titles are so similar.If you want a better \"\"marrying for money\"\" movie, check out Black Widow, starring Debra Winger & Theresa Russell.These movie is cheesiness at its best..! I just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended.\",neg\\r\\n\"I am surprised that so many viewers didn\\'t find all the symbolism in the movie.....it\\'s what made the movie an incredible work of art! The story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold, yet it is one of the best movies I\\'ve ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline.If you will pay close attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by the stepfather. The older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brother\\'s death. There are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story. To me the answer is because he doesn\\'t want to share such ugliness with his own children, or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety. I\\'ve read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. Although this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination used to come up with that. I don\\'t think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. But, I do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brother\\'s death. However, I like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all.There are many different takes you can have on the movie, but if you take the movie at face value.....two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather - you\\'ve missed the brilliance. The fact that I was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work......dig deep when you watch it. You\\'ll be amazed at the genius contained in the film. The only other movie I\\'ve seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville.....but that\\'s a comment for another movie!\",pos\\r\\n\"I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film. First the film is a homage to Jascha Heifetz, considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century. Secondly having brought to the screen the Dead End kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with Warner Brothers, he was trying to create a second gang of appealing urchins. Though the film was good there certainly was no demand that the kids from this film be reteamed for another feature. Leader of the gang is Gene Reynolds who at one time played the violin, but now leads a street gang of disreputable urchins. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin his late father gave young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school over the feeble protests of his mother Marjorie Main.Young Reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music maestro himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They take him in, but they have their financial problems with a lot of creditors led by Porter Hall.This film is mostly to be seen today because it\\'s a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha Heifetz who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybody\\'s problems. Joel McCrea is in this film also, but has a rather colorless part as Andrea Leeds boyfriend. Besides Heifetz, one thing the film does do is touch on, albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses. Arthur Hohl is one mean man and Marjorie Main is very clearly a much battered wife.The kids in the cast do well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl under the name of Jacqueline Nash who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood, nightclub partner to Nelson Eddy. She had a nice soprano even as a child.But it\\'s Heifetz you see the show for.\",pos\\r\\n\"This film is like \"\"The Breakfast Club\"\" meets \"\"Mad City.\"\" It\\'s got one plot twist after another with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman, and James Remar delivering really great performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you don\\'t like movies that \"\"go all the way\"\" with regards to violence, then don\\'t watch the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I couldn\\'t take my eyes off the screen. This is a really gritty, realistic teen drama. I can\\'t believe it came from B-Movie king Roger Corman. This film is a must-see for those who are not faint of heart. Highly recommended.\",pos\\r\\n\"For every fan of coming of age tales, this 3 hour adaptation of theSarah Waters novel is pure fun. Cinematic nods to Baz Luhrman\\'skinetic style, as well as to all those prim and proper period piecesever present on the BBC (where you\\'re likely to have seen almostevery prominent member of this cast). It\\'s rather bawdy and overthe top in spots, but that\\'s just what the novel called for. The castis appealing and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and HughBonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroineNan, you simply must overlook the fact that she\\'s far too pretty toever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. It\\'s a fantasy, after all. Some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes incharacter (particularly that of Jodhi May\\'s character, Florence), butthe changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay andprovide an overall high quality entertainment value.\",pos\\r\\n\"In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works. Watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this. You\\'ll not be disappointed. Good episode to watch is \"\"No Spring for Frazer\"\"\",pos\\r\\nGentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality...and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama....but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years. Immensely sympathetic performance from Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma...hopefully without poor Richards penchant for hellraising and haminess)....and charming offbeat cuteness from costar Yu Xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer. Radiant location photography (including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall) and sensitive direction by Ann Hu give film added impact. In short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life...and making magic in the dark.,pos\\r\\n\"Just ONCE, I would like to see Koontz\\'s work given to a decent screenwriter, director, and producer! JUST ONCE!This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. The screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing Koontz\\'s work this way and the director...please.The story is a well-written story, but the screenplay is quite dull, unbelievable and horribly executed. The only elements which work are the performances by LeClerc, Sarandon, and Tennant.On a personal note, I really wanted this to work. I adore Koontz\\'s novels, but they have never given them the attention, backing, and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz\\'s work that they shovel by the barrels-full into King\\'s, Koontz would quickly rise above. But alas! Without powerful people who believe in his work, I fear he will never get the chance.As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a total suck-fest. As a stand alone movie, it wasn\\'t that bad, though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible, stiff, unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut. This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. Had they followed the original work by Koontz, a bit more closely, and invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a far better endeavor.However, all I can manage to see in this, is how good it could have been, and wasn\\'t.It rates a 4.3/10 from...the Fiend :.\",neg\\r\\n\"This little short absolutely fascinates me.The only thing I\\'ve seen thus far like it is some of the work by Sam Brakhage, the creator of Dog Star Man. However, where Brakhage is trying to unnerve by \"\"making us learn how to see again\"\" and provide us with an affront of head-ache inducing bright colors and flashes (which I still totally dig and embrace as high art...), this film I would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotizing. Man Ray\\'s general use of spinning objects/camera does not create so much of a dizzy feeling but a warm flow of senses, intermingling and going along with the gravity of the moving world around us.An interesting conceit of this very short work is that as it goes along, objects become more and more recognizable until we end on a nude torso (of which I feel is the least feminine well-rounded breasts I\\'ve ever seen). The circles and spirals of shadow and light over the torso make it an object of surrealistic beauty, something that you could hang on your wall and delve over forever. It\\'s because of this and other images in this film that I had to watch it again and again (eventually a total seven times) just because it utterly fascinates me.--PolarisDiB\",pos\\r\\n\"The chaser\\'s war on everything is a weekly show from the guys that brought you CNNNN and the chaser decides where each week the 5 chasers and Firth break down the issues that we didn\\'t know were important.This show goes beyond the mere satirizing of politics and television by not being afraid to take the mickey out of anyone whether it be a counter-girl at subway or even the prime-minister of Australia and although this may be familiar ground in say American television it has never been this well executed.The Chaser\\'s war on everything is the smartest, funniest and overall most entertaining show on Australian television and if you haven\\'t seen it you seriously owe it to yourself to give it a watch.\",pos\\r\\n\"Though I saw this movie about 4 years ago long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now I often reviewed something just after seeing it. What can I say? Well, the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the title character who, after finding out about a man\\'s killing the drug-dealing boyfriend of his daughter, wants to bond with him even though he\\'s a Madison Avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lower-class conservative Joe. In fact, there are plenty of funny scenes of Joe at this guy\\'s party making smart alecky remarks there. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they\\'re looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after overdosing on some drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon making her film debut! This was a pretty hard-hitting movie for the time it was made (late \\'60s-early \\'70s) and was compelling work from scripter Norman Wexler (later of Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later to do Save the Tiger, Rocky, and The Karate Kid). Certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years! Highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time. P.S. Among the cultural artifacts seen here are a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz crackers, a bottle of Heinz ketchup, and, unique for the era, a Nixon poster asking, \"\"Would you buy a used car from this man?\"\"\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is awful. It creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an obnoxious little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.The animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by Hollywood.The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. Hanks was overdone and i don\\'t see why there couldn\\'t have been other actors\\' voices be used.\",neg\\r\\n\"I really liked this picture, because it realistically dealt with two people in love, and one of them having a disorder. Though the ending saddened me, I know that that was the best way for it to finish off. I would recommed this to everyone.\",pos\\r\\n\"Wow! My mom bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap in some store in my town, and she knows I love scary movies. First I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking that it was some ordinary B-movie trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the great big mistake watching it alone, my parents and my brother was asleep and it was really late. After I seen the movie I was so scared I was shaking... I didn\\'t even dare to go up and take the videotape out of the VCR! I slept with the lights on...This movies main story is about some teenagers who drives off the road and have to spend the night in the woods, telling scary stories... The first story is really scary, and it makes you hug a pillow really hard if you watch it alone.. The second story is scary too, but not in the same way as the first one. The third story (my favorite) is really, really creepy. It scared me most of all stories. It is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle. One night when there\\'s a storm outside, he goes to the closest house and knocks on the door.. A girl opens, and she is mute.. Don\\'t wanna tell you more, but you will get chills when you watch it (I might add that my heartbeats were really abnormal when I watched it). \"\"Campfire Tales\"\"\\' main story has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it sucked, but me, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and it was a long time since we got that scared.. rating: 10/10, oh by the way, it is NOT like Urban Legend at all, it is so much scarier.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on. This movie is practically McHale\\'s Navy for the 90s or Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the Navy in order to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it. Many of the Navy phrases and terms go over my head, though, but it\\'s a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a very interesting acquaintance! \"\"Two-fisted tales\"\" contains three foolish and childish episodes - genre isn\\'t actually horror or action, more like something in between. Where\\'s the suspence? Where\\'s the fun? Where\\'s the common sense? Definitely not in here but if you don\\'t expect to get it, you don\\'t necessarily miss it.First segment is called \"\"Showdown\"\". It\\'s a violent, absurd western. I failed to understand the whole idea of it. \"\"King of the road\"\" is a stupid story starring Brad Pitt. At the time of \"\"Two-fisted tales\"\" he was just a pretty face who really didn\\'t know how to act yet. Luckily he learned the skill later and now he\\'s a fantastic, talented actor - one of the big ones of the younger generation. Story is almost ok in all of it\\'s stupidness. Final episode \"\"Yellow\"\" is the only segment that\\'s almost entirely successful. It\\'s foolish but funny. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that.This movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn. (I should know, that\\'s what I did) If you loved \"\"Tales from the Crypt\"\", you\\'ll love \"\"Two-fisted tales\"\" too because basically it\\'s all the same. I understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare \"\"piece of art\"\" and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS but I don\\'t think it\\'s a big privilege. You\\'ll have to be a fanatic Brad Pitt fan to search it out. Otherwise don\\'t bother, it\\'s not worth the effort. Silly crap.\",neg\\r\\n\"I finally watched the third film in Mehta\\'s trilogy: \"\"Fire\"\". To begin, I\\'d say that \"\"Water\"\" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I\\'ll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. The writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of \"\"heat\"\" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships. Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from. India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change. That she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of \"\"Water\"\" after having had the script cleared, shows that there are still many taboo subjects which Indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face, cannot examine or discuss them. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats. So, as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always so. Whereas \"\"Earth\"\" was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence, Fire and Water are pointing at personal, social and religious issues, which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away. As I write this \"\"Water\"\" is scheduled to actually be shown in India later this year. I\\'ll believe it when I see it. Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I saw in \"\"A price above rubies\"\". Whether it\\'s arranged marriages (which it used to be like among Jews about 150 years ago, or like it is among many modern Indians), they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or, just plain loveless marriages..... However, this is not the real issue. Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire). I am no expert regarding either the secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce. The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage. In any case Mehta\\'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny. That all three of these films have made themselves felt in India as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset. Mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack. I admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough. Superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.\",pos\\r\\n\"A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game, but once they start playing it, they each start dying just like they do in the video game. As they become addicted to the game, they need to find a way to beat the game\\'s central villain, The Blood Countess, before she kills them all.The premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining. However, this \"\"horror\"\" movie is not scary at all. It\\'s actually more of a comedy than anything else. The film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch. Sure, there is the occasional laugh but for the most part, the film is very dull. PG-13 horror films can still be good like The Ring or Cry Wolf. The Ring and Stay Alive aren\\'t really the same type of horror film though. Stay Alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated PG-13, the death scenes are very tame. It should have been the movie\\'s main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered.The acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leading man. He lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him. His character isn\\'t unlikable just very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive. That\\'s an honor on the level of being the best player on the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible as October. Her performance feels so rushed and so fake. The most annoying character in the movie is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die.In fact, most of the characters are pretty unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film. It\\'s just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it\\'s a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive. The only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It\\'s a little old but it still kind of works. The film is also really short so it\\'s not too much of a pain to sit through. I wouldn\\'t really blame the cast though because they were working with an inexperience director and writer. The direction is not very good and the screenplay isn\\'t much better. Stay Alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006. That honor would go to When a Stranger Calls. Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity though. In the end, this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf. Rating 4/10.\",neg\\r\\nI own this movie on DVD and I have watched it about 10 times and it\\'s still funny. The jokes will never get boring and I often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant. They are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in.To watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour. Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But overall it\\'s a great movie.,pos\\r\\n\"Hearkening back to those \"\"Good Old Days\"\" of 1971, we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole Season of Charles Chaplin at the Cinema. That\\'s what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody\\'s old talk show. (We can\\'t recall just whose it was; either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles\\' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former \"\"Little Tramp\\' from Los Estados Unidos on the grounds of his being an \"\"undesirable Alien\"\". (No Schultz, he\\'s NOT from another Planet!) CHARLIE had been deemed to be a \\'subversive\\' due to his interest and open inquiry into various Political and Economic Systems. Everything from the Anarchist movement from the \\'20s (and before), the Technocracy craze to Socialism in its various forms were fair game for discussion at Chaplin\\'s Hollywood parties; which of course meant the inclusion of the Soviet style, which we commonly call Communism.COMPOUNDING Mr. Chaplin\\'s predicament was both confounded by one little detail. He had never become an American Citizen.ANYHOW, enough of this background already! SUFFICE it to say that he had become \\'Persona Non Gratis\\' in the United States of America. .It was high time to get the old films out of the mothballs and back out to the Movie Houses. It\\'d sure be a great gesture by us easily forgiving and quickly forgetting Americanos.IT would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist; besides, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences was planning to honor Chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 Oscar Show. This would surely be a tearful yet joyous packaging of pathos a plenty for having America invite Charlie back and have him come and receive a special Academy Lifetime Achievement Award in front of a World-wide Television Audience numbering in the Millions. BESIDES, that would be a natural for promoting the Chaplin Season at the Theatre! (Remember, the Little Tramp was as astute as a Bu$ine$$ Man as he was as a Film Maker!) THE program consisted of showings of MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, THE GREAT DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, A KING IN NEW YORK and finally THE CHAPLIN REVUE. We remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film fest.IN our fair city of Chicago, it was booked for the Carnegie Theatre on Rush Street. The festivities lead off with MODERN TIMES and all of the others would be shown one at a time, each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the public\\'s desire to view each picture. As we recall, the very last on the schedule was THE CHAPLIN REVUE.IN RETROSPECT, we look back and wish that they had begun the run with REVUE; as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers (much like ourselves) who knew very little about his accomplishments in motion pictures, except for those Keystone, Essanay and Mutual Silent Shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so, so many Kiddy Shows all over the country. Oh well, once again, no one consulted me!CONCENTRATING on today\\'s honored guest film, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we found that it was actually three separate pictures; carefully bound together by the use of narration by Chaplin (Himself), some lively Themes and Incidental Music (once again written by Chaplin) and some happy talk and serious narration (Ditto, by Chaplin.) He opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movie-type of film depicting the construction of the Chaplin Studio in Hollywood, as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time, showing Director Chaplin demonstrating just what he wants to a group of actors.THIS segment was well done and well received by the audience. Both the building humor and the rehearsal were amplified by making them seem accelerated. (The rehearsal naturally, the building by use of speeding up the camera\\'s photographic process. The old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselves.THIS amalgam of shorts incorporated three of Chaplin\\'s short comedies from his stint with First National Pictures.; roughly that being 1917 to 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and mood.FIRST up was SHOULDER ARMS (Charles Chaplin Productions/First National Pictures, 1918). As the title suggests, it is a tale of World War I. Released in October of 1918 with about a month to go before the Armistice Day of November 11, it was a comedy of comical Army gags and a romance between Private Chaplin and a French Girl (Miss Edna Purviance). The levity is fast, physical and in the grand old tradition of ridiculing the Enemy, the German Army.DISPLAYING an excellent example of the old adage about Children and Dogs bringing folks together, the next film A DOG\\'S LIFE (Chaplin Productions/First National, 1918) traces the parallel lives of Chaplin\\'s Tramp and a newly adopted stray, Scraps. The movie story involves families, two of them. One Homo Sapiens, one Canine and both supplying us with some big surprises.AS the finale, we have THE PILGRIM (Chaplin/First National, 1923) was a good choice to have as the finale. It was bright, light and tight. It was an excursion into the area of the Western Spoof, Comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team. The \"\"Pilgrim\"\" in the story is not of your standard Thanksgiving Variety; but rather a \"\"dude\"\" or \"\"Tenderfoot\"\", who has ventured out West. The Tramp is not only that guy; but his character is an escaped Convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new Clergyman of a Western town\\'s Church!OUR Rating (that is Schultz and Me) is ****. (That\\'s Four Derbies)POODLE SCHNITZ!!\",pos\\r\\n\"1st watched 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Henri Verneuil): Sober drama about a well-to-do Doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman, whom his family brings in to live with them, as well as being married to another in the same household. His searching for happiness is not clear, but they do bring out the reason for his unhappiness rather well by displaying the overbearing trait of the females in his wife\\'s line. Well played, but predictable drama.\",neg\\r\\n\"Sigh. I\\'m baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. And we got the \"\"joke\"\" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright?But I guess what\\'s really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE, THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal. I mean, what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker? \"\"Give your head a shake\"\" as Don Cherry might say.\",neg\\r\\n\"I was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, \\'real life\\' story line. That is, a twenty-something guy flops in the Big Apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It just might have worked but there\\'s a problem. And that problem\\'s name is Casey Affleck. Casey Affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. His acting mantra must be \"\"exert as little effort as possible at all times\"\". Or \"\"why speak when you can mutter?\"\" Or maybe \"\"put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls\"\". Lips moving when speaking? Barely. Facial expressions? None. Muscles in face? Atrophied. Something? Nothing. ANYthing? Zip.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably first ever written review of a film I\\'ve done of my own accord - not for some class assignment. I think that fact alone says something about this movie... not a good thing! I am no seasoned journalist or critic (though I have seen my fair share of movies), but I found this particular film so terribly painful to watch, it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience. Where better to do it than IMDb? As I forced myself to sit through the movie, physically writhing from the inability to connect-the-dots, I was sure there would be some \"\"light at the end of the tunnel\"\" - a revelation to explain what in samhe.-.ll was going on. The movie ended and I was as enlightened as dog****. After several rewinds to review certain scenes I still could conclude nothing sensible. I found myself wanting to yell \"\"Does this make sense to anybody?\"\" I would recommend to not waste your time, but then again if I were you I\\'d probably want to experience it myself. If that\\'s the case, bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don\\'t get bored.\",neg\\r\\n\"*The whereabouts of Al Capone*Who shot JFK?*Cynthia Gibb lands the part of \"\"Gypsy\"\" in the TV remakeThese are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. How else can I say it, except, I thought she was unredeemingly awful. Mannequin mannerisms, poor reactionary acting (ie: that blank, stoic stare while he co-star in the scene speaks)and a singing voice that most voice coaches would rate \"\"mediocre\"\". But she is stunningly gorgeous and after all, wasn\\'t that what the Gypsy character is all about? Cashing in on her looks cuz\\' she didn\\'t cut the mustard in the talent department?As for the rest... Bette is fantastic. Whether or not she\\'s playing herself or playing Mama Rose, it works either way, and I for one thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as drywall in the original. Peter Riegart as \"\"Herbie\"\" is the perfect understated foil to Bette\\'s over-the-top Mama, and he\\'s the medium-temperature porridge between Midler\\'s hot dish and Gibb\\'s stone cold mush. Riegart is juuuust right.One final holler to the man responsible for decades to come of Cher jokes: Bob Mackie. Drag queens would kill for the glitz and glamour on display here. Everything\\'s coming up sequins and bugle beads!\",pos\\r\\n\"Alien Express is one of the worst movies I\\'ve bothered to experience.The plot is predictable. The aliens look like rubber sock puppets. The effects would have been mediocre in the 70\\'s, but are just atrocious by today\\'s standards. Couldn\\'t they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model?The acting isn\\'t great but, really, the dialogue is the worst part. It gouges its way into your mind. \"\"Don\\'t you die on me. Not now.\"\" If you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie, you\\'ll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens, the model train, or the clich\\xc3\\xa9d dialogue.The only reason I didn\\'t give this movie a \"\"1\"\" is that it doesn\\'t deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film.\",neg\\r\\n\"***SPOILERS*** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival Witch across town Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia getting her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a promotion at his job at the Giger & Greengrass law-firm over the more deserving Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erica has her cast a spell on Hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself.Larry finding out about Erica\\'s attempt on his best friend Larry\\'s life has a violent fight with her causing Erica to fall from the balcony to her death. It\\'s when Larry goes back to his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things begin to really heat up, emotional and sexually. The wicked Amelia tries to have the dead spirit of Erica take over Carol\\'s body and end up murdering Larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband Hal\\'s injury that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair.Not much of a story but lot\\'s of cheese and soft-core action with poor Larry getting manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her. Amelia is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn\\'t a threat to her. Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break-in, then his mind, by being accused by the police as being the murderer, and finally is life, by getting blasted by Ameila herself. As he\\'s made to runs into the Reynolds\\' house, under her control, as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled Hal. Larry Parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of \"\"Sorceress\"\" and ended up being in the cast playing his part as Stan. Without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god-awful bad the movie really is. Stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn\\'t have to suffer,like those of us watching, through the entire brainless and mind-numbing movie.It becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of \"\"Sorceress\"\" that all this shenanigan\\'s on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie. The ending is about the best thing, besides Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman cast, that one can say about the film.\",neg\\r\\n\"...instead, watch it as a great coming of age tale about African American males in the mid 1960\\'s in the ghettos of Chicago. For all of you out there under the age of 50, \"\"What\\'s Happening\"\" was a light-hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) concerning a group of young African American high school kids living in a working class neighborhood. I liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. \"\"Cooley High\"\" started out as being the basis for \"\"What\\'s Happening\"\", but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences, so it was redone as a comedy, even though the credits on \"\"What\\'s Happening\"\" still read that it was based on this movie.This film starts out light, but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960\\'s and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. The guys deal with sex, betrayal, joblessness, hopelessness, and even early death. The ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either.\",pos\\r\\n\"This B&W film reached the spartan movie house of my Frisian village about 18 months after its release. In those days much of our full-length comedy fare hailed from Denmark (Nils Poppe anyone?) so this movie struck like a thunderbolt -- it had me weeping with helpless mirth, ROTFL as we\\'d now put it. OK, so some of the sight gags were in fact recycled vaudeville \\'schtick\\', but how was this \\'barefoot boy with cheeks of brass\\' to know that at the time? In any case, my favorite scenes had Jerry\\'s unique brand of frantic clowning, like that Hawaii boxing match.Seeing \"\"Sailor Beware\"\" again fifty years later I still guffawed loudly at the goings-on. Granted, without the nostalgia component it would probably be just another fair-to-middling comedy. But then, another movie that once had me in stitches even more helplessly, the Spike Jones outing \"\"Fireman Save My Child\"\", now seems dated and stilted apart from some too-short orchestra bits and Doodles Weaver scenes. Must be some special ingredient that makes Martin & Lewis product stay fresher longer. To me this one at least rates eight out of ten.\",pos\\r\\ni love watching the Jericho mile. i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter. i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him. i\\'ve watched the Jericho mile 100\\'s of times and will watch it 100\\'s more. great movies get watched more than movies that are not. i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make it.they are great people and i bless them all.thank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all.,pos\\r\\n\"I bought this film from my local blockbuster for 99p an it\\'s been sitting in my video bookcase for at least a year now. Then tonight I decided to see it, the film was quite different to what I had expected and I didn\\'t find any humour in it all I saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and I didn\\'t really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the end of the film. I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. I was following her emotions and what happened around her. Some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but I could really put myself in her place, loving someone but them rejecting you at every turn no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different sexualities well. I was expecting something like Bound & Gagged : A love story, but this is a very different film. Not for bigots.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke\\'s marketing problems. We also know he is an eccentric genius. Roberts\\' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.Unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.Usually, I am a sucker for bold and far out plots. Examples which I am fond of include, \"\"Dark Star,\"\" \"\"O.C. & Stiggs,\"\" and \"\"Popeye.\"\" Coupled with the fact that I must admit that this film was well acted, it surprises even myself that I cannot recommend this film.The utter breakdown in this movie occurs about midway through the film. All comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark. Afterwards, the film plods along. The film\\'s attempt to get the comedy rolling again is not successful. More surprises await the viewer and they are darker still.To be sure, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. However, with this movie, the result is about as successful as \"\"new coke.\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"The unthinkable has happened. Having first witnessed it a few years ago, I have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called \"\"McCinsey\\'s Island\"\". A family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I\\'m not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film I\\'ve seen that made me wonder what else the film\\'s budget could have been spent on. Like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. However, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump \"\"Guest House Paradiso\"\" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies I\\'ve ever had to watch.Based loosely around the puerile but amusing TV show \"\"Bottom\"\", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. His buddy Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run Britain\\'s worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. Between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. The plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the Guest House Paradiso, much to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And... that\\'s it.I used to think that the Carry On films represented everything bad about the UK film industry and God knows, we\\'ve spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. We\\'ve had films like \"\"Trainspotting\"\", \"\"28 Days Later\"\", \"\"Four Weddings And A Funeral\"\" and the brilliant \"\"Shaun Of The Dead\"\" (also starring Simon Pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of Sid James and Barbara Windsor\\'s top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. \"\"Guest House Paradiso\"\" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. I kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. Just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. Come the first ad break (it was on TV, you see) and I was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. \"\"I\\'m watching this so they don\\'t have to\"\" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.Trust me, I used to love the \"\"Bottom\"\" TV show. The combination of suitably grubby acting from Mayall and Edmondson with OTT juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. Certainly not for an hour and a half, as Edmondson and Mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. Honestly, this makes Mayall\\'s \"\"Drop Dead Fred\"\" seem like \"\"The Godfather\"\" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. They\\'d probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The movie equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.\",neg\\r\\n\"I recently bought this movie on DVD at a discount store for $5. Although it is a no-frills DVD on the Geneon label (just the movie that starts playing immediately - no menu, no special features) the picture and sound quality were EXCELLENT. The movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history.Richard Jordan, who I must admit to not having heard of, plays the lead - Pinky Green. A charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the lead bad guy, also with the great charm for which he is famous. Bad, but with scruples as when he refuses to deny Pinky his \"\"whack\"\" for the job. Whack, in England, apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in American gangster films! All the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable movie.What is perhaps best, to me, is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable (I frequently find myself lost in plot confusions and various characters) without ANY special effects. NO blood. No violence. Not even a single car chase! Just a well written story, well acted, well directed and well photographed! If I had any complaints about the movie, I would question the music. WHAT is bluegrass music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in England?\",pos\\r\\n\"Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving it and the other one hating it. As it concerns \\'Halloween:the Curse of Michael Myers\\' I fall into the latter category.I\\'m of the opinion that John Carpenter, in 1978, made one of that decade\\'s finest fright films, which despite its flaws, still holds up well into the 21st century. It reused many of the old horror film devices but utilized them in original and effective ways. It had no pretensions that it was anything other than a movie about an escaped mental patient stalking babysitters on Halloween night. And yet there were \\'ideas\\' in the film but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull. It juxtaposed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was taking place in the story and it did this with a wonderful ambiguity. The \\'filmmakers\\' of this \\'film\\' probably wouldn\\'t even understand that previous paragraph. That\\'s why we\\'re saddled us with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid. Direction, script, acting are of the lowest strata imaginable. This is the type of film that is so mind numbingly dull and nausea inducing as to make you want to crawl back into the womb and die. It is also truly, truly sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence wasting his acting abilities with this saliva puddle of a movie. He seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the fact that this may be his last film. Maybe that\\'s what killed him.\",neg\\r\\n\"Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yeah it\\'s hard to keep your mind off this fetching beauty (giving an radiantly picture-perfect performance), as she simply has tongues wagging. \\'One Night at McCool\\'s\\' is a dementedly quirky and raunchy black comedy with old-fashion shades tied in to its familiar, but smartly crafted and chaotic narrative which has three men lusting after the one women and she\\'s milking it to her advantage. When you see Tyler, no wonder why they are infatuated and would do anything\\xc2\\x85 that\\'s anything to see \\'her\\' happy and living \\'her\\' dreams. Just like Tyler, there\\'s something rather intoxicating about this feature in that we see the likes of Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who\\'s great) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the hired assassin with cool-ease, but a questionable hairdo) really having a good time with their roles. The consuming plot opens up with the main three characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) telling their story of how they came to encounter this divine presence and the eventual affects that she\\'s having on them to lead to an insane climax. There\\'s an unpredictable chain of events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything would virtually tie in together with a certain ironic (snowball) twist of fate for the characters (that see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl). Howard Zwart\\'s direction is colorfully zippy balancing the script\\'s quick-fire gags and frenetically fun, if complicated situations. One of the best under-the-radar comedies in the last decade, which will have you under Tyler\\'s thumb.\",pos\\r\\n\"Sex is Comedy, though not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot, concentrates effectively on the relationship between film-director and crew during the process of film-making, whilst successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and more specifically the issues and problems encountered by actors involved in filming sex scenes. Director, \\'Jeanne\\', features prominently throughout, for it is she who carries the plot forward, in the place of a narrator, and gives us numerous little pearls of wisdom to think about. She is a social commentator, relating to her assistant and others the problems she finds with her new male lead by way of associating him with a masculine stereotype. Their ambiguous relationship typifies something about human nature \\xc2\\x96 the tendency to be fickle. On one hand, the two seem close; when he is not in sight, she claims to hate him. Jeanne also addresses his masculine pride perhaps in a feminist take on things.The taboo of what constitutes obscenity, is raised: the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful, because it is fakeness which constitutes obscenity - that is the director\\'s justification. This is, however, doubly ironic, for the film we watch is in itself a construct within a construct.There\\'s more to this film than just relationships, of course. Watching this film is not simply a question of analysing it for the sake of drawing out some sort of meaning. One can delight in the natural lighting which pervades the movie. This makes it realistic and believable. A static camera is sometimes used taking in a heavy composition and at times the camera appears shaky like a home movie. If you\\'re looking for something fun to watch on a Sunday afternoon that isn\\'t too heavy but still leaves you thinking: this is it.\",pos\\r\\n\"A genuinely odd, surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page; just what drew Robert Redford to the project, one may never know. Sidney J. Furie directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing; the kid looks up to this anti-hero, and eventually begins to ape his amorality. Disjointed and off-putting--though for some, the sight of Redford disrobing, about to disrobe, or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention. Lauren Hutton gets naked too, however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurient-minded; there simply is no story. Perhaps Furie was making an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970. If true, then this pre-Blank Generation approach backfired, as the film was not a success. *1/2 from ****\",neg\\r\\n\"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have got to be one of the best buddies ever to work together. They have made lots of movies together, i think they are both fantastic when they do work together in a movie. Out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie i think to watch. I give the movie 10 out of 10. Jack lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on tv. They will be sadly missed. God bless you both.\",pos\\r\\n\"Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching thismovie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you tomake your toward your TV set\\'s cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.\",neg\\r\\n\" It\\'s common knowledge and has been said before: No one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer having been divorced from ex-hubby Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re-make (God-forbid!!!) she still cannot rise to the occasion (i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she\\'s got brown eyes [Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh\\'s eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in SCARLETT the novel and GWTW, of course) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett is, you would most likely need a higher-pitched voice, like Vivien Leigh. I suppose I\\'m comparing Kilmer to Leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as Leigh did with Scarlett you simply can\\'t help but to criticize any new prospective Scarletts. Timothy Dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell\\'s Rhett and Gable in the film had none. His acting has never been truly noteworthy (except, maybe his portrayal of the evil, conniving King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little (if any) freshness or vitality to his Rhett.  Standouts in the cast are most notably Tina Kellagher (a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there\\'s Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil Lord Fenton, Mary\\'s nemesis and Scarlett\\'s eventual violator. One thing I could not forgive the writer for was the fact that Scarlett is raped in this movie (a fact that never occurred in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and of ill-repute among the Irish in the book but he\\'s nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. Another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of Belle Watling, played most horribly by Ann-Margret in a cameo role, which we all could have lived without, seeing as how the book was such a run-away bestseller without requiring any assistance from Ms. Watling. For a film by itself, SCARLETT is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel. Another actress was highly necessary for Scarlett as well as Rhett.\",pos\\r\\n\"There are a few scripts like this one floating around Hollywood; this one is not even close to the best--just the first. This is all production value, no substance, but the Disney name probably will help it. A good idea, a wasted opportunity.\",neg\\r\\n\"The Toxic Avenger, Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with Ron Fazio) had rid his home town Tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this), Toxie now works as a concierge at the \\'Tromaville centre for the blind\\'. It\\'s not long before trouble rears it\\'s ugly head though, an evil chemical producing company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to take over Tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of Toxie. After the evil chairman\\'s (Rick Collins) first plan fails he bribes Toxie\\'s psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan & see his Father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his Mother (Jessica Dublin) & his home behind Toxie heads for Tokyo, Japan. Once there Toxie sets about finding his Father & a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his quest. Meanwhile back in Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. move in for the kill & without Toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) whom he has been lead to believe is his Father, however Big Mac is all part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once & for all...Produced & directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz this follow up to the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves the first film was a complete fluke, a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy, outrageous violence & so-bad-it\\'s-good film-making, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a load of crap in comparison. The script by by Kaufman, Phil Rivio & Gay Partington Terry with a load of \\'additional material\\' credits does not contain one single funny moment during it\\'s entire 102 (uncut director\\'s cut) duration. The visual gags are terrible, Toxie walking through Tokyo with a wig & glasses to blend in for instance, or a scene where he heats up a bath with a bad guy in it & as he cooks Toxie throws in a load of vegetable\\'s & spaghetti, a scene where he sticks electrical wires up a woman\\'s nose, sticks an antenna in her head & a microphone in her mouth to which a Japanese radio announcer talks into, a bit where a Japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish, a bit where Toxie grabs a swordfish head & uses it as a weapon, or the embarrassingly bad overacting & stupid idiotic facial expressions, a guy who literary has a fish for a head & gets turned literary into sushi, the awful comedy music & sound effects & the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing & memorable. The bad taste gags aren\\'t there this time round & the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing, it just feels like a real step back from the original & lets not forget this is Troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing. There are a few gory fights & some serious gore & violence, at least in the supposedly uncut 102 minute version I saw, crushed heads with the bodies spurting out blood, smashed faces, intestines, roses poked in someones eyes & thorns wrapped around their throat, ripped off ears, severed arms & a very graphic & gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces. Unfortunately the special effects by Pericles Lewnes aren\\'t particularly convincing & come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes. The acting is of embarrassing proportions as I\\'ve already mentioned. Action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end & a few unexciting, lacklustre fights utilising cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. Horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart. Comedy wise this is very unfunny. In fact The Toxic Avenger, Part II sucks on all levels really & to top it all off it\\'s atrociously made as well, most of the cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner, continuity is none existent, cinematography is basic point & shoot & the special effects are anything but. One or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain & simple, do yourself a favour watch the original again instead.\",neg\\r\\nI am sorry but this is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another. Not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary film I have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end (actually I can\\'t believe we watched it to the end) but I think it is because we couldn\\'t quite believe it.,neg\\r\\n\"[Minor spoilers follow]Steve Allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula: Tragedy+Time=Comedy. 1939 before the German assault on Poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events, including the Blitzkrieg (following the Sitzkrieg) which took Germany to the Channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation at Dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine France prostrating its honor before the Nazi conqueror.The stuff of romance, comedy and a big dollop of serious drama? Yep. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with a well-matched and outstanding cast, creates in \"\"Bon voyage\"\" a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining.Viviane Denvers (the sloe-eyed and beautiful Isabelle Adjani) is France\\'s top actress as war clouds gather over Europe (what an overused cliche, sorry). A veteran self-venerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be \"\"Whatever is good for Viviane is good for...Viviane). Following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent Reynaud administration, Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, she goes home only to tiredly encounter an ex-lover who doesn\\'t understand the word \"\"no.\"\" She decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau, the still besotted Frederic (Gregory Derangere), to help deal with the mess in her flat. Frederic is a novelist-in-expectation.A comic accident that once again highlights, almost as a public service message, the importance of working windshield wipers puts Frederic in jail on most serious charges. Fortunately the breakout of the Germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of France but our boy escapes, making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state.The panic and fear in France as the Germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story. Who should Frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant, Camille (Virginie Ledoyen) who is accompanying the obligatory Jewish refugee scientist, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has some bottles of \"\"heavy water\"\" he needs to get to England. Of course the Germans musn\\'t latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what (this part is pure fiction-there was never any heavy water in France in 1940-just Perrier). And Camille is so winsome as well as dedicated.What next? Peter Coyote as a supposed French journalist, Alex Winckler. Be tipped off as to his name. He\\'s really an officer in the Abwehr (German military intelligence: a spy). And he used to bed Viviane too (and wants a reprise of their affair). Apparently the kind Kopolski is the only major male character who doesn\\'t want to have it off with the actress.What follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fast-paced and enjoyable film. Partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on \"\"Casablanca,\"\" this is is a remarkably funny movie (except for the heavy Nazi bits).Isabelle Adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal I\\'ve seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few if any redeeming features. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to jump ship and join the traitor, Petain, is convincing as a man whose ardor for Viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the Republic. As a human being in power at a critical moment in French history, Beaufort is mundanely vile.Not shown in too many theaters, \"\"Bon voyage\"\" should be available for purchase or rental soon. See it!9/10\",pos\\r\\n\"I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull. I found myself disliking the main character and the following actors/actresses that came in the scenes. The camera work was non pleasing itself. Random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and I turned the film off. I will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Becoming Jane; and Pride and Prejudice. I\\'ve only a few others to watch besides these films but I believe they were done in great taste. The music was kind of out of place with the film also, reminding me of another show I had seen this year. It was called Hex and a show from BBC. I came across it one night on the web. I rather liked the first season but the second season was dry and pulling things out of thin air that should of stayed with the clouds. I found the main male character who was Henry in this film out of place. Perhaps I just do not like his way of speaking or his stature. Well I would not recommend this film to anyone unless they were going to have it muted and they wanted to look at the fashion of the era, or the way homes were kept at the time. Again I will watch the 1999 version and hope it is a better and does Jane Austen some justice to her writing.\",neg\\r\\n\"I used to work in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night.This movie was truly awful, there is no redeeming quality about it, because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it. If the first film wasn\\'t low budget enough then this film truly takes the biscuit, being housed (mostly) indoors and at night...therefore avoiding the scenic cost setting of the first film In the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically runs over an attractive student. Rather than be mortified, the lecturer half heartedly apologises and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars bonnet (he sped up as he approached her) that there is nothing to worry about...after which he attacks her with a crowbar and kills her! If this isn\\'t strange enough, he wants to perform an experiment upon her, bringing her back from the dead....and so feels the need to remove her clothing to do so.Soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) is rampant throughout the film and is, to be honest,the only real thing to hold the average male viewers interest...like the swimming scene in the first film...but even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting, crappy dialogue and absurd plot turns....why introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes....its just a very very bad film\",neg\\r\\n\"When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it is bad. I wanted to claw my eyes out. I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to \"\"unwatch\"\", if only it were possible. The other films being \\'Troll 2\\' and \\'Fast and Furious\\', both which are better than this crap in the hat.I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good Seuss name.To Mike Myers, I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn\\'t mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.\",neg\\r\\n\"Humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of The Wog Boy seemed to enjoy it more than I did. I found it an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the Australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. The boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos while I found laughs thin on the ground. If you want to spend your money on this, wait until it\\'s on video.\",neg\\r\\n\"Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a road accident. End of story.\"\"End of story\"\", that is, in the sense of \"\"end of any physical action\"\". Not in the sense of \"\"end of the film\"\". Ken\\'s life is saved, but he is paralysed from the neck down. When he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive. The rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die.Ken\\'s main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, here it is presented in purely secular ones. If Dr Emerson has any deep religious convictions, these are never expressed in the film. He believes passionately, however, that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight; to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty. Ken therefore finds himself in a \"\"Catch-22\"\" situation. He must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. Emerson, however, considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality. Ken\\'s dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital.Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr Emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity, but this cannot hide the fact that \"\"Whose Life is it Anyway?\"\" simply does not work as a film. At one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. When plays were filmed, therefore, the general tendency was to \"\"open them up\"\" by filming on location as well as on studio sets, by taking liberties with the playwright\\'s text, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters.I have never seen Brian Clarke\\'s play, but I suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema. There is very little physical action; most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed. Such a plot does not lend itself to the \"\"opening up\"\" device at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by talk at the expense of action. Although it is well written and there is some good acting, I am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject. 4/10\",neg\\r\\n\"this took me back to my childhood in the 1950 \\'s so corny but just fab no one ever could play FLASH GORDON like LARRY BUSTER CRABBE, just great. i have two more series to view flash gordon\\'s trip to mars and flash gordon conquers the universe cannot wait\",pos\\r\\n\"This program is certainly my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very little good programs - most of the TV which I watch (and I live in Australia) is from the US and England.The funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is. Like when they went past numerous security barriers at the APEC summit pretending to be Canadian diplomats.The show is made up of pre-filmed stunts, general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes on-stage skits. These all come together to make a fabulous, extremely funny TV show. The segments like \"\"Ad Road-test\"\" and \"\"Message from Osama bin Ladin\"\" are hilarious. For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch.All the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour.I would rate it 10/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies, and a third one is coming our way this summer.The first one, which was released in the summer \\'04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a blind, deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film\\'s faults. Whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable, there were a lot of things that could be improved on. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.The action first of all, was incredibly cinematic. The lighting, setting and style was three fold as effective as in the first movie. In the first we were given basic action, well animated and choreographed animation, but nothing eye popping, however this movie\\'s cinematography was exceptional, the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fighting.The animation was very good. It rivalled Disney, however since this is a movie about TV characters, there was nothing exceptionable about the character design or detail to the actual characters, however, the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used twice the amount of cels for each second because there was absolutely nothing jittery about the animation at all, it was incredibly fluid.The music... I think that\\'s where this movie fails. The original composer/conductor for the TV show was used for the film, and I don\\'t really feel that he did that good of a job. The music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesisers used for the film couldn\\'t convey the tune very well. However they didn\\'t fail the film at all, adding as a good accompaniment to the action. But, except for a few violin/string pieces towards the end and some choral work, the music didn\\'t excel any boundaries or act as anything special.The story was fun. It was a reasonably typical storyline for Naruto and was very similar to the first movies, except, again, it took everything that had been wrong with the first film\\'s story and improved upon them. The characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film. It kept making you think the film would be ending any second now, but then it would move on, but instead of feeling dragged out, the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and exciting.Overall, this film is a goodun, but however good it might be, it is most definitely one for the fans. I enjoyed the film, but thats because... I\\'m a fan! But I can see, just like with Final Fantasy\\'s Advent Children, it doesn\\'t excel as a movie, but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half. Though I think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current non-watchers, it won\\'t give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to Naruto screens. However, despite all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of upsetting fillers.\",pos\\r\\n\"Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O\\'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse. As always, it\\'s really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the Disney magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O\\'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is... well... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old hounds Napoleon and Lafayette into a couple of bumbling Southern-fried rednecks. Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney\\'s style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are fussier (a pity) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin.\",pos\\r\\n\"What\\'s fun about Barker\\'s Nightbreed is that it\\'s the story of a human on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this one, the monsters (the night breed of the title) are the \"\"good\"\" guys. It shares its sense of celebrating the different, the twisted, and the dark with the first Addams Family movie, and much of Tim Burton\\'s work. It also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by Barker.Especially fun is the performance by Cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the Nightbreed. As happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters\\' castle with torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic \"\"weapons\"\" with guns and bombs. And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein\\'s monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.This isn\\'t a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work. But it\\'s pure fun, it looks great, and remains light without mocking itself. Worth a look!\",pos\\r\\n\"A film for mature, educated audiences...I saw \"\"Random Hearts\"\" in an advance screening shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I\\'m sure this story will not be everyone\\'s cup of tea, especially considering the film\\'s darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford (\"\"Star Wars,\"\" \"\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\"\" \"\"The Fugitive,\"\" \"\"Air Force One,\"\" \"\"Patriot Games\"\") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer, Dutch. Ford\\'s very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis (\"\"Forrest Gump,\"\" \"\"Back To The Future\"\") in his summer 2000 thriller, \"\"What Lies Beneath,\"\" and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy\\'s \"\"The Sum Of All Fears.\"\" \\'Fears\\' will be Harrison Ford\\'s third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.Director Sydney Pollack (\"\"Out of Africa,\"\" \"\"The Firm,\"\" \"\"Tootsie\"\") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to Scott-Thomas\\' congresswoman. It\\'s a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see \"\"Eyes Wide Shut\"\" as well).Kristin Scott-Thomas (\"\"The English Patient,\"\" \"\"The Horse Whisperer\"\") shows that you don\\'t necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford\\'s quiet-man toughness.The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving Ford\\'s character\\'s investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by \"\"Heat\"\" actor, Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in Dutch\\'s investigation into police corruption.The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as Wendy Judd.The technical side of Pollack\\'s thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusin\\'s (Pollack\\'s \"\"The Firm\"\") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to Philippe Rousselot (\"\"A River Runs Through It\"\") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film\\'s unfortunate downer premise.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. \"\"Random Hearts\"\" is definitely one of the better films of the year.(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)\",pos\\r\\n\"The ultimate gritty heist film. Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra will leave you sweating & satisfied. In comparison, it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films, such as \"\"Oceans Eleven (remake)\"\", reviewed in such high regard-especially in Europe. Films like Rififi must be shown, spoke about, and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics what true classic Noir is.Criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer.\",pos\\r\\n\"First, don\\'t be fooled by my family name. My mother was full blooded Italian, so I really know Italian families, and I LOVE mobster movies, even the funny ones like this.For those people who have bad rapped this film (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don\\'t know what good is. This is a damn funny and well-styled film. The fact that almost nobody is Italian in it is part of the joke, so far as I can see. And what red-blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this film it won me over with the opening song by Rosemary Clooney who was as Irish as one can get, but her pronunciation of the Italian words in \"\"Mambo Italiano\"\" is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. (Hell, I even bought the record the next day because of it.) Just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that I have personally seen in my relatives houses, though not in the same place (which I found hysterical) sold it for me.This movie is like Goodfellas on laughing gas. I just wonder why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? My guess is the crew ate it. \"\"The Fries are crispy. The shakes are creamy.\"\" My mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous Ms. Pfieffer. (And I never trusted clowns anyway.) And the three best things about this film are Mercedes Ruehl\\'s achingly funny mob wife spurned, Dean Stockwell as her philandering husband Tony \"\"The Tiger\"\" and last, but DEFINITELY not least, the great mugging by Oliver Platt who should get more comic roles. And note to myself: find out where that black chick went. Ouch! Why does she work so infrequently? This picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be.\",pos\\r\\n\"They were alternative before there was alternative, The Residents are a band like no other, and I love them for it.

But that is just the beginning. As a bonus it even has Renaldo & the Loafs hauntingly beautiful \\'Songs for Swinging Larvae\\' and even features The Residents cover of it.

It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary.

Isn\\'t that biting social commentary?\"\" And,sadly, the answer is always \"\"Ummmm...no.\"\" Wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality.

What was this movie about? Knight? The season? The Players? What? It was all over the place all the time. It had no tension (sorry, we all knew Bobby was going to curse and throw things) but Brian Denehy, a fine actor, comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension. Cheaply shot, like a MacGiver episode. Contrast this Thanksgiving main course with the job HBO did on the Don King movie \"\"only in America\"\" to show how to do sports biopics, warts and all.

You may be wondering by now why or even how i managed to sit through the full hour and a half of sheer inanity, and it is honestly a difficult concept for even myself. Firstly, i had to pace up and down as the film progressed as i found it extremely hard to get comfortable. Secondly, i only made it without gnawing off my own arm in order to have something to beat myself to death with by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. The problem was it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes, and that was a fatal error on my behalf.

Maybe that\\'s the way they wanted it to look, maybe they think it\\'s cool to do movies in 80\\'s fashion like it will come back in style. Who knows...If you think the promised eye-candy will save the film, you\\'re in for a disappointment--the so-called \"\"babes\"\" are manish and downright ugly. They can\\'t act at all, I don\\'t understand why they couldn\\'t at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent! But I guess when you\\'re making a film this stupid, you don\\'t get very good choices, hot chicks aren\\'t just lining up to do this kind of pitiful crap!\",neg\\r\\n\"Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a farm girl from the country coming to the city looking for love. She has met a man that has told her of an Astrologist who will show her the stars. This is a journey of souls...Eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage. They show each other different ways of looking at things. All the while Eliza is still looking for love and Tommy is trying to protect the reservation that his grandmother lives on. This is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things. The style is artsy and chock full of symbolism. The psychedelic camera styling might scare away the average moviegoer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching. It is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird, wretched and devastated individuals. This one strays from the path but certainly worth watching!\",pos\\r\\n\"Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana, 1927\\'s Sur un Air de Charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and that\\'s the best way to view it. Jean Renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together. The plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes \\xc2\\x96 in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris where a white native girl teaches him the Charleston (naturally he assumes she\\'s a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of \\'White Aborigine\\' music). There are plenty of surreal touches, be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in Catherine Hessling\\'s hair, the angels the girl telephones (Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger among them) or the fact that black performer Johnny Huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while Hessling\\'s dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent, and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion, but there\\'s not really enough to sustain it for two reels. An additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on Lions Gate\\'s new DVD\\xc2\\x85\",neg\\r\\n\"Although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society, I don\\'t object to the extremely high salaries for many of today\\'s entertainers and athletes.A-Rod, LeBron or Brady all have deals either well with 8 figures, or the low-9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows, huge residuals and fees they currently demand. Even their cast members, and all of the \"\"Friends\"\" group reached near or over 7 figures per episode. Letterman\\'s earnings for one show could solve most people\\'s financial problems, and a week or two\\'s take care of many for life.But all of these are based upon sound supply/demand principals, and the financial benefits they bring to their employers. And all perform their crafts ably.But then comes along someone like Rachel Ray, who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. I find her shrill, annoying, and with a forced \"\"perkiness\"\" that\\'s as phony as the proverbial \"\"3-dollar bill.\"\"A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates. One of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $5-10K level, to a handful who get $200K and up per appearance. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams, and, no kidding, Larry the Cable Guy.)There are a greater number in the $100,001 - 200,000 range; list included the likes of Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even cable guy Larry\\'s benefactor, Jeff Foxworthy. This category includes Rachael Ray. I suppose I have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her \"\"talent\"\" and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who\\'ll pay more than $100K, + first class air, hotel suite, all expenses and limos door-to-door, for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization\\'s event. I just can\\'t figure how-in-the-hell this could be possible.\",neg\\r\\n\"Looking back on the year 2006,one of the things i will remember most is the \"\"Snakeamania\"\" on the internet for a film called Snakes on a plane.But unknown to me there was a straight- to- DVD rip-off film called Snakes on a train!After seeing this i feel its at best a below-par B-Movie.The plot:A husband and wife get on a train to go to Los Angles,to get help form the husbands uncle who is a shaman.This is because the wife\\'s family do not approve of her marring him,so they have put a curse on her that snakes will \"\"become her\"\".Thought with a sixteen hour drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers the include an ex-Narc cop and some drug traffickers.Will they get there in time before the snakes take her over? View on the film: First the effects:I have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gory-way,the main effect shots you have to wait eighty minutes to see!Are sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the film(The film makes 198os Video Games look like T2 next to this!.)One of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic it ruins the whole film. Final view on the film:A below-par B-Movie,with an unbelievably bad ending.\",neg\\r\\n\"I\\'m not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it\\'s unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She\\'s a loyal friend and always the peace maker. There\\'s subtle romance which is what I like, personally. Not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. Every character eventually gets it, and they don\\'t find their prince charming at first glance and they don\\'t just \"\"fall in love\"\" with every guy that comes their way. It\\'s a realistic show but when you watch it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture, and random facts because Lorelai Gilmore is always making references. I fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, so will you.\",pos\\r\\n\"Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Arnim\\'s novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. All the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story\\'s appropriate resolution.The actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife longing for \\'wisteria & tranquillity\\' far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle. Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene she\\'s in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past.The men in the story are also well cast. As Miss Harding\\'s husband, Frank Morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as Miss Alexander\\'s spouse, is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for England (his hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bathtub is made even funnier with the assistance of Charles Judels & Rafaela Ottiano as the castle\\'s harried servants). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the decade\\'s finest forgotten actors, is joyously eccentric as the ladies\\' lighthearted landlord.Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Ethel Griffies playing the proprietress of the Hampstead Housewives Club.\",pos\\r\\n\"Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) Your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e. \"\"Constantine\"\"), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it\\'s good (a la \"\"Manos The Hands of Fate\"\"). Now that I\\'ve seen \"\"Dr. Gore\"\" I know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich. That will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A work that is mind-bendingly execrable. Anathema.I have hated certain films before, but I\\'ve never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its thresh-hold and became SELF loathing! Have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the hour you spent watching it, but makes you grieve for another hour after that? Mystery Science Theatre disciples beware, this is soul-sucking cinema. Go Rent \"\"Circle of Iron\"\" or \"\"The Killer Shrews\"\" instead.\",neg\\r\\n\"I know a lot of people would claim certain films as \\'the worst of all time\\' but I think Redneck stakes a claim for this prize. A combination of quite dreadful acting from both Mark Lester and Telly Savales and plot progression that defies belief.On Telly Saveles: was he drunk when he acted in this? He seems to play a slurring, laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction. Maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, I don\\'t know.On Mark Lester: A performance more wooden than a carpenter\\'s workshop. His clipped British tones don\\'t belong in this film; and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangster\\'s apprentice in 24 hours is mad. And the strip scene with Mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all; perhaps the director likes this sort of thing.Plot logic: when Memphis and Mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why doesn\\'t Mark Lester\\'s mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car, before the loonies drive it off? She just lets them all go, without saying a word!! On the other hand, Redneck has to be seen - you won\\'t believe how bad it is otherwise!\",neg\\r\\n\"Do the writers that conjure up these type of \"\"comedies\"\" have such empty lives that they have to embody them in tragic shows like this?.Why the talented and gorgeous Busy Phillips is amongst this trash is beyond me,I cannot stand the Hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so unfunny and annoying as is the other African-American girl with the shrill voice.The jokes are often stupid, the Jewish guy yells a lot and the show never goes anywhere, one particular episode with the solider looking for love was just terrible.I don\\'t believe there would be that many working in a looking for love office and only one man? Of course all of the Woman are in tight fitting tops and tons of make up to make up for their lack of talent.I actually found Holly funny in her older shows and I have always admired Busy but this show is dumb, empty and had nothing going for it.\",neg\\r\\n\"By strange coincidence I\\'ve started to watch this move straight after Brice de Nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than Brice de Nice, so I was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop.Unfortunately OSS-117 again left me disappointed - I don\\'t know, maybe it\\'s just problem with translations, but since \"\"Diner de Cons\"\" I haven\\'t seen ANY French comedy that I would call really good. Even when I look at the reviews on IMDb only people from France are giving the OSS-117 high notes...For me this movie didn\\'t really work - in some parts is as funny as real Bond movies, in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny.\",neg\\r\\n\"If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious!! I am a Madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release. However, over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun. Sure there are some bad lines & cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with Madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast. She is cute,funny, and is the only comedic role of her movie career. Madonna usually just plays \\'herself\\' in roles but watching her as Nikki Finn in this film, she really seems like somebody else for once. Of course the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting \\'At Close Range\\' with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and co-stars Griffin dunn (\\'After Hours\\') who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material. The story is nothing genius and don\\'t expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80\\'s romp or if you are a Madonna fan than this is a MUST SEE. The Soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 Madonna songs: the #1 hit \"\"Who\\'s That Girl\"\", the #2 hit \"\"Causing A Commotion\"\" and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads \"\"The Look of Love\\'\\'(Top 10 Hit in the UK) and \"\"Can\\'t Stop\"\" a left over pop ditty from the \\'True BLue\\' sessions the year before. It is only on VHS but will soon be available on DVD.\",pos\\r\\n\"It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no clue. I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between the have\\'s have not\\'s. I got it way back in the beginning. Kids and Bully was done in such a way that I actually felt like I was observing the realities of that group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and ever worse acting. Teenage Caveman, which Larry didn\\'t write but did direct, was terrible. But at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn\\'t take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just plain bad.\",neg\\r\\nI guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight.This is a morons delight. The worst stereo-types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable. Every character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy. Lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked.***Spoiler*** how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place?,neg\\r\\n\"Well, for this abomination of a film, I wasn\\'t expecting anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. Somehow, this film was even lower than my expectations, even when I didn\\'t have any. Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let\\'s just say that Evan Almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable. Actually Evan Almighty was had the EXACT same plot outline as Noah, with the exception of a few technicalities, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far-superior movie that was actually FUNNY. Another thing, did anyone get sick of Wanda Sykes\\' stupid, unfunny, redundant, one-liners that were literally in every single scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more. Despite the fact that I basically had already seen the film ten years earlier(Noah), Evan Almighty has to be the most predictable movie I\\'ve ever seen. I figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off Noah left and right. In conclusion, if you\\'re a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see Evan Almighty, and are already sick of Jonah Hill playing the same role in every single movie he\\'s in, liked Bruce Almighty, and don\\'t want to see a predictable, dry, unfunny movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, then please, don\\'t see this piece of garbage.\",neg\\r\\n\"Very glad to see that this excellent film gets such high marks from the users of IMDB. The Best Years of Their Lives remains the finest cinematic statement about veterans returning from war that I have come across. Easily the finest performance by the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact the entire cast shines, including music legend Hoagy Carmichael who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this excellent film to anyone who loves movies.\",pos\\r\\n\"At the beginning of \\'Loggerheads\\', we\\'re introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters. To make matters even more confusing, we\\'re informed (via titles on the screen) that the action is taking place in three separate time lines (between the years 1999 and 2001). It takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related: Mark Austin, a young man in his 20s, gay and HIV Positive is estranged from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. Mark is now a drifter and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town, where he meets George (sensitively played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other. Meanwhile, Mark\\'s birth mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17. Similarly, Mark\\'s adoptive mother, also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him (despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband).\\'Loggerheads\\' we\\'re told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its Achilles Heel. Director/Writer Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found. Take Mark and George\\xc2\\x97they\\'re both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about. There\\'s some slight tension when Grace faces off against an Adoption Agency Director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager. No sparks fly either between Elizabeth and Robert since the good Reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son. \\'Loggerheads\\' is similar to \\'Brokeback Mountain\\' in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males (for example, the Kure Beach cop and the Reverend) are the baddies. The biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction (and hence no dramatic conflict) between Mark and either one of his \\'mothers\\'. Mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him. Kirkman\\'s theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it\\'s too late! Kirkman\\'s sentiments are for the most part well-intentioned but they do not make for good drama. Loggerheads moves along at a snail\\'s pace without providing any new revelations (or suspense) regarding such topics as AIDS, Adoption and Homophobia. Ultimately \\'Loggerheads\\' fails due to a lack of originality.\",neg\\r\\n\"Having been raised in Canada, I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC. I have seen it numerous times, at many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging around.Every kid growing up can relate to the situation, and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless. I haven\\'t seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has.Sure I am a Montreal habs fan, and that makes my appreciation for it more special. But in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey, and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isn\\'t exactly what you wanted. And oh yeah, the animation is beautiful too ;)Rating 10 out of 10\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a pretty pointless remake. Starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece chiller that was. The new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy.Brian Kerwin plays a \\'city boy\\' photographer who returns to a semi-abandoned desert town populated by a scattering of underdeveloped clich\\xc3\\xa9d stock characters: the lollipop sucking Daby-Doll Lolita, the \\'ornery old coot prospector, the crippled vet and his Asian wife, etc...Kerwin\\'s character witnesses the crashing of \\'something\\' into a hillside and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of weird blue rock are scattered around. The temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area vanishes, people start to act weirdly, things explode. Kerwin\\'s character gets in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in one movie. The film develops no sense of place, no character development, no humour, no tension. Everything that made the Jack Arnold\\'s original a creepy little Cold-war paranoia classic has been abandoned. It just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends.The special effects aren\\'t very special - the interior of the ship looks like bits of cling film wrapped round some ropes which were then dangled in front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wire-work ever put onto the screen. The script is repetitive - everyone says everything at least twice, Kerwin gets to say \"\"let\\'s get out of here\"\" at least three times during the movie, twice in one scene. Loads of things are left unexplained at the end - why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example? - not that anyone watching would care; if the film makers didn\\'t care why should we?The acting is adequate - better than the script, which at times, has an under-rehearsed improvisational quality, deserves. Though often the actors look like they just want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible - a notable example of this is when Elizabeth Pe\\xc3\\xb1a registers the briefest, token moment of \"\"frustrated despair hands to face gesture\"\" before following sulking son Stevie outside to watch him do \"\"angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table\"\" gesture. Continuity errors include the (GB) sticker on the back of Kerwin\\'s jeep appearing and disappearing, a double action of the gas in the exploding car, a towns-person being in two places simultaneously - once in the Alien Stevie\\'s POV shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot, Elizabeth Pe\\xc3\\xb1a appearing to shut a car door twice... you can tell I was gripped can\\'t you? The movie commits that greatest of errors. It\\'s boring.\",neg\\r\\n\"Irvine Welsh\\'s follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh, all with a few of Welsh\\'s trade marks, drug culture, depression, the working class and Hibernian football club. Uneasy to watch in places, it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to it. Will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will no doubt adopt a cult following.\",neg\\r\\n\"Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.While I know enough about the directors\\' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, \"\"Nurse Sherri\"\" is really not all that bad. Sure, it\\'s clear that this was very low-budget stuff, yet all that I found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects. The acting is not as bad as one might expect, either.There are two different versions available of this on DVD. A much more sex-oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of T & A is the original cut, with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their \"\"strangest sex\"\" moments, including one involving fellatio during a college lecture!The movie would then be re-cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly. Some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with Stevens, the role played by J.C. Wells, expanded). The movies\\' most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works quite well. This cut of the movie is more interesting overall; I would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them.Both versions hit their stride in the final third, and benefit from a marvelously scene-stealing performance from Bill Roy as the crazed Reanhauer, and a moody climax set in a graveyard (although actually filmed in Adamsons\\' backyard!). Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), who\\'s lost his eyes in a car accident, and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. The movie also makes amusing use of music from composer Harry Lubins\\' personal collection, including compositions for such TV series as \\'One Step Beyond\\' and \\'The Outer Limits\\'.\"\"Nurse Sherri\"\" (known by more alternate titles (including \"\"Beyond the Living\"\" and \"\"Hospital of Terror\"\") than any other Adamson movie) is actually fairly entertaining low-budget fare. I ended up having a good time watching it.7/10\",pos\\r\\n\"Someone asked why it was canceled I tell you why Because \"\"reality\"\" makes money. the show surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a \"\"reality\"\" show, this will haunt NBC, I and about half of my high school, about 1000 people total have vowed to boycott NBC, until they bring this show back. in my area (I don\\'t know about other places) but they had a great thing going with the Sci-Fi channel where the Sci-Fi channel would show last weeks episode at 7:00 and then NBC would show the week\\'s new episode at 8:00 this was great because it gave you a little refresher as to what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show was canceled and they were going to just leave them on top of the church like that!\",pos\\r\\n\"I watched this movie which I really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end. The problem I think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad \"\"effects\"\" which got me annoyed through the film. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. This film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end. The film could never beat Stanley Kubrick\\'s geniousness when it comes to controversial matters, weirdness and originality in movies.\",neg\\r\\n\"The idea for the movie wasn\\'t too bad: a horror film shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part was the shoddy camera work, the ten million shots of puddles and corn, and the hour and a half long walk this guy took in the maze. Oh, I\\'m sorry, the \"\"maize.\"\" I picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. But taking everything into consideration, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much further with it. Bill Cowell\\'s acting wasn\\'t too bad, in fact, I would say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent from his co-stars didn\\'t help his efforts. Here\\'s to hoping his next movie will be easier to swallow.\",neg\\r\\n\"For me, North and South (Books I&II) is the ultimate TV series of the 80\\'s. Just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining.Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johny Cash\\xc2\\xa1 No series has come close to this achievement.Have you ever seen anyone looking like Lincoln? Dick Smith\\'s prosthetics made Hal Holbrock\\'s powerful performance even more so. The crafted costumes, the jaw dropping locations, everything. It\\'s clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright TV series (Desperate Housewives, Lost,24) but North & South was, and still is, one of its kind. Don\\'t miss it. Only David Carradine\\'s portrayal of the ultimate villain (you may call him just violent husband) worths the viewing. Maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped, I admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them. I\\'m so glad that finally is available on DVD in Spain.\",pos\\r\\n\"Oh dear. this was quite possibly the worst film i have seen in years. I mean what more can be done with the old \"\"woman inside mans body\"\" storyline? it was full of cliches, eg the nerd coming into his own sequence, the \"\"lad\"\" getting whats coming to him etc. im not calling these spoilers because any one could guess what happens!! the only thing it had going for it was Laura Fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the \"\"dream\"\" boy, that was the wettest piece of acting ever. even the bad guys were instantly forgettable.terrible movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"If you\\'re looking for a typical war movie, this is not it, so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there, don\\'t bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don\\'t expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. It\\'s not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It\\'s a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting, cinematography, writing: all perfect 10s here. You\\'ll certainly appreciate it if you\\'re Russian like me, but even if not, you\\'ll probably love it. If you speak no Russian, look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version. It\\'s got subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing on this one I\\'d say is just as good. It\\'s of course not as good as the original Russian track (some stuff is lost in translation), but just as good as the English subtitles. So go check it out, especially if you\\'re studying film in any aspect.\",pos\\r\\n\"Anthony Wong stars in both this and the original (far superior) Untold Story, but the similarities stop there. Wong doesn\\'t reprise his role obviously, and instead plays a bumbling policeman who gets involved with a rather suspicious female, Fung (1994\\'s Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun) who\\'s a repressed nut-job, sure. But her tame jealous \"\"wanna be with a guy who\\'s with a girl\"\" killer is no where near as compelling as what Wong played in the first one. The movie itself seems tired and by the numbers. Yeung Fan as the physcho\\'s love interest\\'s unfaithful girl tries to keep one from total boredom by stripping down whenever possible, and Sun does have a nice ass, but even that can\\'t save this dud.My Grade: D Mei Ah DVD Extras: Sub-titled interviews with Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong filmography; a very brief synopsis; Theatrical trailer for the film; & trailers for \"\"Chinese Erotic Ghost Story\"\" and \"\"Twenty Something\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"I purchased a DVD of this film for a dollar at the big dept store. That\\'s probably the best and kindest comment I have to offer on it. At least it didn\\'t cheat me out of the cost of lunch.The problem with \"\"Chiller\"\" is Craven\\'s problem as a director. The man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove he\\'s a really smart guy and all-around sharp conceptualist. But it\\'s no secret that, as a director, he has never possessed one iota of the visual and story-telling sense of a Hitchcock. As vigorously attested by \"\"Chiller\"\", he\\'s much closer to that legendary flat-foot Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film- making.Let\\'s be specific. The transitional moments of this film are sleek. The establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production. The film looks professionally put together, in the way a film shot by a TV commercial director would. (A thought: The films only visual distinction, these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors.) It\\'s the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions -- the drama -- that fall flat. The core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled. The critical shots (after, say, the departing car drives into the well-positioned camera, then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital, then to the waiting area and hallway, then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action) are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part. Craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. The net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts, and the fumbling rush to keep things moving, is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils, fussily adjusts his easel and lighting set-up, grinds all his pigments, stretches and primes his canvas ...and then has nothing to say. Craven, like the art student, never gets to the meat of the exercise.For Craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for TV, I will point to Spielberg\\'s \"\"Duel\"\" and say no more.\",neg\\r\\n\"\"\"Death Machines\"\" takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss\\' opponents) and turns it into an unwatchable mess. I have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget, bad acting and incoherent script released as a so-called \"\"movie\"\". It\\'s easily the worst martial-arts/action oriented movie I\\'ve seen in years, eclipsing even \"\"Ninja Holocaust\"\" (which at least had some good energetic fight scenes). The actual \"\"star\"\" of the movie is the white \"\"Death Machine\"\", (it\\'s basically his vehicle) so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He\\'s in good shape, and he\\'s not bad looking, but as an actor he\\'s barely there - think Chuck Norris in \"\"The Octagon\"\",only without any energy or emotion.This is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director...but you have to be Arnold to pull this kind of thing off, and this guy is no Arnold.The movie (and the director) can\\'t seem to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally posed, like: Who was the shadowy figure giving the marbled-mouthed Asian lady her orders? How did the \"\"gang war\"\" end? Why did the mush-mouthed Asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed? And what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick? It does, however, find the time to film a completely extraneous bar fight in which a sailor (well, he looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box didn\\'t work. It\\'s only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also K.O.\\'s the movie\\'s \"\"hero\"\", a bartender/karate student who was a victim of the \"\"Death Machines\"\" first major assignment (he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher). It follows this up with one of the most un-called for \"\"love scenes\"\" between the hero and his girlfriend I have ever watched. The segue makes no sense - at the end of the bar-fight, she\\'s grimacing over his splayed limp body, and the next thing they are in a \"\"tasteful\"\" shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a Hallmark card. BTW, we never see the sailor again. And wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station, but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. The movie is a textbook case of poor casting and community theater-level actors floundering without decent direction. The three \"\"Death Machines\"\" come across as clods; the \"\"hero\"\" knows his lines but can\\'t carry the movie, given that his character is an ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other minor parts are barely watchable. All this makes for a fairly poor movie- but the \"\"dragon lady\"\" does more to drag the movie into subterranean stinker territory than anyone or anything else. She looks ridiculous; her tiny, inexpressive face is overpowered by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe, and she talks with a terrible mush-mouth delivery that screams \"\"needed time with a dialog coach\"\". Poor lady - she was obviously way out of her element, and as far as I know, never appeared in a film again. Add to this a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; crappy film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is strictly from hunger; and a general all around dreariness and lack of energy in the blocking and the stage business...and you have one lame movie. I got this as part of a 50 movie DVD compilation, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. It wasn\\'t worth it. Feh!\",neg\\r\\n\"Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART ? It starred Mel Gibson who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace . The film contains over 200 errors . Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS ? That`s the John Wayne western where the Duke saves a homestead called Vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . If you watch WE WERE SOLDIERS you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .First of all what`s with that Scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? I mean what`s the connection between Scotland and `Nam ? Maybe Wallace is using it in the vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - Undeservedly I might add - with several Oscars then so might this film ? Whatever reason it`s included it really jars . Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like \"\" They`ll never take our freedom - The hell they will \"\" and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and Moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movieWhen not reminding the audience of other movies WWS also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not Asia . Hal Moore might have brushed up on the French experience in Indo-China but if that`s the case then he was unique because the American military went out of their way not to read up on the French Indo-China war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict Westmoreland replied he had nothing to learn from the French \"\" Who haven`t won a war since the days of Napoleon \"\" so I was confused as to the portrayal of the NVA in this movie , when in 1965 the American high command , brimming with hubris held the North Vietnamese and VC in contempt . It`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of Vietnam are superlative warriors . They are , but very few Americans believed this in the mid 1960sThere`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? No bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the La Drang valley . Likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the Americans out number the NVA ? I put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of Wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . Take the scene where the American burned to a crisp is flown away screaming \"\" Tell my wife I love her \"\" . This should have an emotional impact similar to THAT death scene in PLATOON but here there`s no impact . In fact I found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words \"\" Tell my wife ... \"\" while mutilated or dying , I counted at least two other characters use the phrase . Did characters actually say this at the battle ? I`ve no idea but since Randall Wallace wrote the script I do have reservationsI sat in shocked awe watching APOCALYPSE NOW , PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water , I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET , I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER , and after seeing WE WERE SOLDIERS I felt totally patronised\",neg\\r\\n\"I remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre. I recently found a copy on VHS & it held up to my memory of it. While obviously not a \"\"big budget\"\" film, the acting is quite credible & the scenery, locales, & costumes are very well done. I only wish the Mammoths had been in more of the picture, but when you see them, they are also well done (remember, SFX was done in those days without benefit of computers, some poor devil had to actually put all that hair & fake tusks on real elephants!)...the same effect was used on the elephants in \"\"Quest for Fire\"\". A better than average adventure film & a chance for the star, Rod Cameron to play something besides a cowboy, which he also did very well over the years.\",pos\\r\\n\"One True Thing may have seemed like a horror movie to the yuppies of the 80\\'s, but it doesn\\'t ring true today... unless you happen to be part of a pampered, upper-middle class family which is so insulated from the world that it has never tasted suffering.Avoid this shallow flop.\",neg\\r\\n\"I bought this movie at a thrift store. Months before, my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies we\\'ve seen. Once I spotted the cassette, I knew I had to have it. I watched it that night. I could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done. . . That\\'s what drew me to it. I popped it in and I laughed the whole way through. I recognized Gregory (The Ice Cream Man), but I didn\\'t recognize his name and I couldn\\'t remember where I saw him. Later, while watching the Andy Griffith Show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was featured as an extra since he is Ron Howard (Opie Taylor)\\'s brother. I saw the credits and I gasped. I turned to my mom, who was also watching the show, and said, \"\"That\\'s the Ice Cream Man!!\"\" She, too, gasped. This movie is great, but only for laughs and criticalness. It is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick. If you feel like laughing as well as poking fun at low-budget movies, rent this video.\",neg\\r\\n\"One of the finest movies I have viewed...Good script, original plot of a man who is haunted about JFK\\'s assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that Cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way,to the crazed gunmen who schemes,lies and murders anybody in his path who\\'ll stand in his way of his mission. The movie accompanies with a great memorable score,and a restrained but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is great,sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played,but how many could acted with such craftiness,and intellect that he displayed in the movie?Needless to say,I thought this was a great movie...everytime it\\'s on television I have to watch it..and I own it on dvd! I\\'m a big Eastwood fan,this only boosted his already fabulous career,and Malchovich\\'s best role to date!\",pos\\r\\nThe Chasers War On Everything. 5 words that I love to watch. The chasers war on everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests they wage war on everything. They seem to love hitting the politions most of all.The Chaser is one of the best comedies I have seen and is the top of the line in Australia. It is on the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC) which is where some of the best comedies are.It has won the Australian Film Industry (AFI) awards but did not win the best comedy at the logies. Last Year (2006) the chaser was aired on ABC on Friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch it. Well they have been moved to Wednesday nights at 9pm (a heaps better timeslot) and the best thing is if I miss an episode or even just want to see it again i can download it from www.ABC.net.au/chaser.,pos\\r\\nI can only think of one reason this movie was released. To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Pearce. This movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes Errol Flynn\\'s memory. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown for Flynn in this movie is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don\\'t waste your time on this utter trash. Watch My Wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.,neg\\r\\n\"It is hard to imagine anyone making a Tom Cruise film look good; hard indeed, but this one makes him look good. Very good. Actually, it makes him look like Sir John Gielgud celebrating Very Good Acting Day with a bravura performance.The acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. The fault was, in part let us be fair, that the plot bore as much resemblance to the HG Wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor. But to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the Colander \"\"My, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable lot of holes\"\", unless, that is, holes are your bag; in which case this film will commend itself to you.The fault in the other part was that these were demotivated, jobbing, DVD actors who knew full well, one assumes, that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the $5 DVD shelf. And overpriced at that.So should you watch it? Why yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.\",neg\\r\\n\"Lackawana Blues An impressive HBO movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several characters.Touching,alive,entrancing-a great mix of sound and story- based on a true story featuring an All-Star cast.A time capsule about .....you get the point and no I am not on the payola for the HBO crew- I would throw around more superlatives but I am about to go out .

I only regret the price of the popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this garbage film.I own the DVD of the original Mask, and quite enjoyed it. I expected a remake nowhere near the original in production values or writing.. but wasn\\'t prepared for this vulgar pile of trash. Weak acting, poor plot, a bad CGI baby passing gas and urinating in hyper \"\"mask mode\"\".. a woman turned into a giant nose, spewing mucous.. Fun huh? My eight year old son loves movies like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After this was over I asked him what he thought. His exact words; \"\"I hated it. It\\'s like the Scooby Doo movie. They take something good and have to put all that gross stuff in.\"\" My twelve year old daughter and wife hated it as well. My wife later told me that my son asker her twice during it if we could leave. He\\'s never done that before. I\\'m proud of him. Lest you think I\\'m some kind of puritan, from the groans, and lack of laughter I heard in the theater, I think most of the patrons agreed with me.This film represents everything bad about children\\'s entertainment today, and any positive reviews MUST be from people financially connected with the film.\",neg\\r\\n\"Here\\'s one of the more pleasingly scuzzy 70\\'s blaxploitation grindhouse items; it\\'s a pervasively low-rent pimp opus which comes across like a sleazier version of \"\"The Mack.\"\" John Daniels, the studly womanizing hairdresser hero Mr. Jonathan in the immortal \"\"Black Shampoo,\"\" gives an excellent steely portrayal of the Baron, a ruthless, business savvy, forever on the make all-powerful flesh peddler who much to the dismay of his bitter, brutal Italian rivals reigns supreme over the Sunset Strip. When not locking horns with his fellow no-count criminal pals or doing his best to avoid being busted by the local vice cops, Daniels is leading a sweetly average existence as your standard garden-variety suburbanite dude (complete with caring wife and loving kids!) in some typically humdrum California small town.The glaringly absurd premise alone promises top-rate trashy greatness of a decidedly Grade B schlock picture variety (George Theakos deserves kudos for his hilariously ludicrous script). Matt Cimber\\'s commendably tactless and tasteless direction delivers the junky goods by the slimy bucketful, thus making this film a hugely enjoyable serving of celluloid grime. Among the assorted squalid delights to be savored herein are plentiful gratuitous female nudity, coarse dialogue, beautifully gaudy Me Decade threads (halter tops, felt hats, sparkling Day-Glo jewelry, loud seersucker suits), an intensely funky R&B score by Smoke, some hopelessly pathetic acting (the little old lady who lives next door to Daniels is excruciatingly shrill), a memorably nasty turn by Patrick Wright as a sadistic goon, a couple of cool action set pieces (the climactic slow motion barroom massacre seriously cooks), more lurid travelogue footage of the Sunset Strip than you can shake a feather boa at (said footage allegedly includes \"\"the actual hookers and blades of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood\"\"), effectively dark\\'n\\'dingy cinematography by Ken Gibb, a few sicko sexual fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of her breasts cut off!), and amusing supporting performances by familiar schlock feature perennials Richard Kennedy and George \"\"Buck\"\" Flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, browbeating police detectives. Sure, this movie ain\\'t art, but it\\'s certainly artless enough to qualify as a deliciously grungy chunk of entertainingly sordid cinematic swill.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw The Merchant of Venice in London last week. Great acting by Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compare to other movies based on Shakespeare\\'s play, this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow. Bravo to Michael Radford for directing such top actors. The costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in Venice it gives the film and authentic flavor. I had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters\\' anti-Semitic behavior toward the Jews and the cruelty of the Christians. I do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case I am sure that it will get few Oscar nominations.\",pos\\r\\n\"Where do I begin? I sat down ready to laugh a bit and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect, it\\'s indescribable. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was grosser, more obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first. This was just what I needed tonight.There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say \"\"Oh My! No Way!\"\" or \"\"Ouch!\"\". Perfectly mastered and set up, each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I\\'m just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular footage in order to prevent an NC-17 rating! It was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway! Amazingly good.9/10. Incredibly funny, Do Not Miss Out!\",pos\\r\\n\"When I unsuspectedly rented A Thousand Acres, I thought I was in for an entertaining King Lear story and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what could go wrong?Very quickly, however, I realized that this story was about A Thousand Other Things besides just Acres. I started crying and couldn\\'t stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast, for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!I recognized the Angry sister; the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh the Father... all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it. I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.Since I didn\\'t understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they weren\\'t fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was able to see that if one hadn\\'t lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!I don\\'t give a rat\\'s ass (pardon my French) about to what extend the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.Keep up the good work guys, you CAN and DO make a difference.\",pos\\r\\n\"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively, the second of the Universal series, where it\\'s again established by means of a written prologue that the famed detective is legendary and spans time. This helps to comfortably set things up here in the \"\"present\"\" era of the early 1940\\'s.In this offering, Holmes goes through a few different disguises (with Rathbone\\'s very prominent features, is it likely that people really wouldn\\'t recognize his true identity?) as he protects a physicist from the hands of the Nazis as well as from Holmes\\' greatest nemesis Professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb sight which will greatly aid in aerial bombardment, and he\\'s promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the Nazis.A good entry boosted a bit by the participation of the properly villainous Atwill now cast as Moriarty (though George Zucco was no slouch himself in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It\\'s always intriguing watching Holmes and his greatest enemy engaging in witty banter together (\"\"the needle to the last, eh, Holmes?\"\").\",pos\\r\\n\"I had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival (which unlike the original 1935 production) which included extensive spoken recitatives. This had been the fashion at the time, so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition. The film should be seen if only for Sammy Davis Jrs brilliant catlike performance as Sportin\\' Life, creeping in and out of shadows. His seduction of Dorothy Dadridge\\'s BESS \"\"There\\'s a Boat dat\\'s leavin\\' soon for New York,\"\" is one of many highlights. Nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung. It certainly never bores which the recent PBS and MET versions did. It was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie, and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven\\'t had a chance to experience it.\",pos\\r\\n\"Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast -- all seemingly digging deep into their characters. The acting here is TOP NOTCH!Credit must also go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension.Remove all of the Viet Nam elements from the story, and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics. (A viewer might see this point more clearly by keeping in mind the \"\"discovering the old photo\"\" scene from the beginning as the rest of the movie is watched).As a movie, I found THE WAR AT HOME to be more direct and to the point than BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY. A fine effort -- almost a 10.\",pos\\r\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s just me, but this movie seemed more like sequel or follow-up than the separate project. Why? When it was filmed (just few years after the war) most of the viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to Allied, why he was Hitler\\'s favorite general, but now, 50 years later, it isn\\'t so obvious anymore.\"\"Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel\"\" is a decent war movie, but it\\'s just isn\\'t in any way explained how Rommel did get his nickname, what was he doing that Allied considered him as their best general, why their soldiers were so afraid of Afrika Korps? That\\'s what is missing in this movie - we see his fame, his character, his way to treat soldiers and enemies, but f.e. we also see that Hitler was complaining about his achievements in Africa, calling him coward, etc. So, we\\'re missing the big picture here - it is \"\"The Story of Rommel\"\", but unfortunately the \"\"Desert Fox\"\" part is missing.\",neg\\r\\n\"Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and also nothing could be more real than Errol Flynn playing Custer. This remains the best film made about Custer. The music of Max Steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the Irish song \"\"Gerry Owen\"\", which was a favourite of Custer is played. The film should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flows like in no other off their films together, and director Raoul Walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best.\",pos\\r\\n\"The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I wouldn\\'t bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.If I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples\\' ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge \"\"pleasure\"\" from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic.\",pos\\r\\n\"I found this movie at a XXX store for $1 on VHS. The interesting thing about it is that Camp Video bought up the rights to it and slapped on a 1986 copywrite date in the credits. Anyways, enough of odd facts.This film is absolutely not scary. To even call this horror or a \"\"thriller\"\" is laughable. There were only maybe 5 minutes at most of what you would call horror in this 80+ minute film, and that consisted of the acting, because it was HORRORible! All puns aside, the writing for this film was absolute garbage as well, just as the special effects and makeup was laughable. No wonder this is such an obscure film, probably the director has spent the last 35 years scouring the country for all existing copies of it and burning them in one big pile so no one else could be subjected to it.\",neg\\r\\n\"I agree with one commentator who says that it\\'s really impossible to review Glen or Glenda? objectively. If one does so, the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious, convoluted dialog, the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values. Yet, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds. It isn\\'t the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. It\\'s not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic.No, what makes Glen or Glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so-called auteur directors like Hitchcock or Godard, despite their vastly superior talents, never did. In Glen or Glenda, Wood isn\\'t afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film. Indeed, the conclusion of the film suggest that Ed Wood\\'s Glen character will be able to \"\"kill\"\" his Glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection Glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist even reassures Glen and Barbara that as Glen makes that psychic transference, Glenda will disappear. So, while Wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general, he wasn\\'t so sure of desiring it for himself.Moreover, Wood wasn\\'t afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen. He did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on. If it didn\\'t cohere, so what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda especially was Ed Wood\\'s imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness.The only comment I wish to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph. The oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities I don\\'t think can be rated.\",neg\\r\\n\"Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. I mention him only because there is an actor in Death Machines who looks JUST LIKE HIM playing the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate. Our hero (let\\'s call him Not Paul From the Diamond Center) plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of The Simpsons\\' Luigi (\"\"you lika da spaghetti?\"\") and seems unimpressed when one of his patrons complains about the food. No, there\\'s no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: there\\'s a Red Buddha in the pasta, the calling card of the murderous crime boss, who sends a statuette to each of her prospective victims. Death Machines is bad by any measure, and pretty boring, which is an even worse crime.\",neg\\r\\n\"I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual \"\"horror\"\" movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the \"\"Exorcist \"\"movies (Which i loved). What was up with all of those nasty \"\"B-movies\"\" she did? David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stick to \"\"Knight Rider\"\" or \"\"Baywatch\"\".All around, this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film. It has horror, action, and drama. It is a suspenseful, and I loved the way Linda Blair turned out.\",pos\\r\\n\"Warm hearted flic depicting arch-angel Michael as a brawling, overweight, cigarette smoking slob who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex.

Funny, well played out film; very enjoyable although somewhat irreverent.\",pos\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to \"\"See No Evil\"\" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole\\' slasher days of the late 70\\'s & early 80s. Think \"\"Madman\"\" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you\\'ll get a good feel for this flick. While SNE is thin on plot (most horror films are), it kind of makes up for it in the violence/methods of killing, the gore, suspense & the fact that Kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers & stores them in big jars. Why?? You\\'ll just have to watch it & see (pun intended). There are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably Psycho, TCM, & Madman but they\\'re not blatant. Finally, SNE really doesn\\'t go into territory we long timers haven\\'t seen before & granted, SNE is no \"\"Pyscho\"\" or \"\"TCM 74\"\" but it certainly merits a look imo. BloodStone\\'s Recommendation: Take in a matin\\xc3\\xa9e showing of \"\"See No Evil\"\" Bloodstone\\'s Rating: 7.5/10\",pos\\r\\n\"To sum this movie up, it is LaBute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce. The predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-curdling violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the PC. Basically the movie just doesn\\'t work, its plot is beyond contrived, the characters are one-dimensional cliches, there is no consistency or development of anything, and the comedy (where it is not totally out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drivel.Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio-driven audience pandering--no matter what, make them likeable, neutral (and neutered), and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesn\\'t belong in movies anymore. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman--it\\'s as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other. In effect, Chris Rock seems like a digital insert. At least he isn\\'t as annoying as Jar-Jar.LaBute\\'s 15 minutes may well be up by now. It\\'s already looking like he\\'s overstayed his welcome.\",neg\\r\\n\"I used to like some of the Hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. They had icons such as Arnie and Sly but I think the action movie in the \\'90s has plummeted to new depths. The worst of these, I believe, was Armageddon.The plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers. The melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon. This movie symbolises the new Hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That is the norm these days and I begin to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for screenwriters. It seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts. The rest they leave to technology. There is not a single piece of grand, heartfelt human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and bland. I can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves Liv Tyler\\'s dad who doesn\\'t even make an appearance in the film. Steven Tyler\\'s band Aerosmith provide a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up.I weep for Western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. It stands for shallowness, lethargy, and a decline in the human intellect. I would even prefer to watch the eighth Friday the 13th.\",neg\\r\\n\"I first watched this in black and white, circa Christmas in the early Sixties, when it was shown on British television. I was absolutely hooked, and watched it over again whenever it was repeated on TV (possibly two or three times only, as it happens - if only we\\'d had video recorders then!).As outlined by other contributors, the plot describes the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper, after a period spent away, to a Forties American city. He finds that all is not as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the \\'lowlands\\' just outside the garden which belongs to a songwriter and his wife) are now under threat from the \\'human ones\\', who are trampling through the broken down fence which prefaces the property, using it as a shortcut.Insect houses are being flattened by their feet, and are also often burned by cast away cigar butts and matches. Old Mr Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity\\'s childhood sweetheart) are in grave danger of losing their Honey Shop to this threat.To compound their problems, devious insect \\'property magnate\\' C. Bagley Beetle has romantic designs on Honey Bee himself, and hopes, with the help of his henchmen Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito, to force Bumble to give him her hand in marriage.Will the heroic and fearless Hoppity win the day, and manage to save the community of bugs from their dastardly fate, and especially his precious Honey from hers? Enjoy the classic songs (\"\"Katy Did, Katy Didn\\'t\"\" is a superb, swinging, upbeat example), and the colourful visuals, as the tale unfolds.Time has not blunted my fascination for this masterpiece of animation and story-telling, and I was much pleased to find that it had been released to video, although I later found out that it was in NTSC PAL format. Never mind, I sent off for the video immediately, and only then bought a portable TV/video combination (complete with NTSC playback).I have enjoyed many nostalgic viewings since then, and have even discovered that the TV rights have switched from BBC (who informed me they were unlikely to ever show the film on any of their stations) to FilmFour, who have (at last!) been showing it on their digital stations in early 2007.My granddaughter (aged three) was absolutely entranced while we watched it together - and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer-generated productions!I would thoroughly recommend this film for any age, and especially the youngest of viewers.Give Max Fleischer a posthumous Oscar!\",pos\\r\\n\"Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film. The fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences, tells you that they have just enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid.............A must rent, view, or see.Don\\'t be afraid of subtitles........its worth a little aversion therapy10/10\",pos\\r\\n\"The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence, but it is not good at all. One 15 minute sequence with Jack Black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all. Every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things, except for the main girls I could not think of one movie where I had seen them before. I hate to bash movies but I also hate not being able to find something decent in movies. The film is sad, not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast. If it were redone and written over it could be awesome. If you want a good movie to see stoned, watch Grandma\\'s Boy, or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused, but this is not a movie to be seen at all.\",neg\\r\\n\"When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer, and a mad biker, together with various other forms of social scum, have had enough of their sh** infested cell, they spot a rat and look for the hole. Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. What soon follows is not surprising. Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.Loosely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I\\'ve seen this year. Running at right around 2 hours 9 SOULS will deliver a story so powerful it\\'ll literally leave you breathless. The beautiful, yet subtle, use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda (Blue Spring, Porno Star), is completely mind boggling as he implements a sense of pity towards the characters. As quickly as each character grasps their dream, it\\'s as quick as it\\'s torn from them. Now, all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director, yet props must go to the actors as well. This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (the son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) delivers a stellar performance, and seems to bring some of his mothers eeriness to the screen.I must give props to Artsmagic DVD as well. This is the 6th film of theirs I\\'ve seen now, and they seem to get better and better each DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and crisp. It\\'s very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer, so the discs from theses cats are nice.Bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers\\' world wide. Keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 SOULS; it\\'s really amazing film to watch.\",pos\\r\\n\"Well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected. It\\'s not boring and it\\'s not unoriginal. It\\'s really not a silly romantic comedy. The situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual, of course, we\\'re still talking about a movie, but the main characters are indeed plausible. Donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he\\'s just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something. The ending isn\\'t one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre. I genuinely liked it and i\\'m hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. It\\'s worth a watch. Besides, it\\'s better directed than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. And they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact, yada, yada. At the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all, the movie makes you feel something, you may even learn a thing or two. It\\'s not the usual hope-producing, tissue moistening idiocy. It\\'s a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around the world.\",pos\\r\\n\"What is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it? Carlos Mencia is no George Lopez. There IS a difference. When watching comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to pattern his show as the \"\"Hispanic/Latino/Spanish\"\" version of the Dave Chappelle show. What a horrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please do not do a \"\"Block Party\"\" movie. As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the reunion of the cast of \"\"Xica da Silva\"\" on one stage, don\\'t.) Carlos Mencia likes to use the word \"\"beaners\"\" as much as Dave Chappelle liked using the \"\"n\"\" word. Neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it\\'s from \\'their own people\\'. Carols Mencia also likes to say, \"\"If you\\'re offended, too bad\"\". It\\'s not the offense, it\\'s the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.Carols Mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. It\\'s not comedy, it\\'s not funny. There is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning.Mind of Mencia needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. Until then, the show, Mind of Mencia is a pass.\",neg\\r\\n\"Victor Mature, as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper, may be on the poster, but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get \"\"cut to ribbons\"\" by Confederate artillery at Shiloh, and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hard to recognize at first Anne Bancroft. The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonel\\'s wife, giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man\\'s wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays Mature\\'s older and wiser mountain man father figure. Directed by Anthony Mann, this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart, but even so you really don\\'t need the Indian menace to make this a film worth seeing, although Preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission, in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout.\",pos\\r\\n\"Notorious HK CATIII actor, Anthony Wong, is for once (well...not actually once - he was a cop in the DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS films and a few others...)not a psychopathic weirdo in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually recognized for his role as a complete wackadoo in such CATIII \"\"nasties\"\" like THE UNTOLD STORY and THE EBOLA SYNDROME - this time, Wong is on the receiving-end of the nastiness...Wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams, for a price. True to his word, the dreams that Wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin\\' hot schoolgirls - but the dreams come with a price that\\'s more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmails Wong out of his cash and business, kills his family, and eventually kills Wong himself...Wong\\'s brother comes to town to find out what\\'s going on, and eventually finds that his family\\'s murder is the work of the evil sorcerer - but as it turns out - Wong\\'s brother is a pretty dope-ass sorcerer himself, and with the help of the sorcerer\\'s abused wife - turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes...EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more enjoyable CATIII films I\\'ve seen in a while. Absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other CATIII entries like RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter, is more \"\"fun\"\" then some of the more serious films of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more \"\"carefree\"\" CATIII entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore, without being overly comedic either. Definitely worth a look, especially to the genre enthusiast. 8/10\",pos\\r\\n\"Leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can\\'t sing. Nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. From the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, McClelland and Stewart were involved in the production), he didn\\'t know how to live, either. The woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. While Irving Layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, Earle Birney, was to remain nameless. I come from the generation just after Cohen, where all the boys seemed to idolize him. His lack of commitment was probably just calling to them. I hadn\\'t realized what a disappointing poseur he was back then.

It really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end. I wish I could be more eloquent in describing the movies many (oh so many) flaws however I cant be bothered/get too angry to form proper sentences. In short I absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in \"\"so bad its good\"\" kinda way...It was unadulterated drek.Gavin\",neg\\r\\n\"The only reason any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belong to the crew, were friends to the crew, or were obsessive fans of either Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. I personally follow the \"\"cult of Lance\"\", so I was disappointed to see that despite being the headliner, it\\'s in name only. Playing rich criminal Newcastle, Lance is a joy to watch but all of his screen time is relegated to the beginning of the movie. Newcastle sets up a 747 heist which includes Ketchum (Lamas) and a bunch of forgettable characters. The biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre-heist scenes were not all that bad. With the exception of somewhat obnoxious and rather confused looking Aviva Gale, who times every line with the finesse of a grade school play actress, acting was decent all around, and none of the lines really made me cringe.But once the heist occurs, the movie falls asleep. Not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film, but it\\'s dragged out for far too long. This isn\\'t a very deep movie, and you have to fill out your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring I nearly nodded off at two in the afternoon. One particular sequence in which we watch each and every one of the characters perform the same task over and over again is especially difficult to get through. The movie\\'s name is \"\"Rapid Exchange\"\", but the exchange is far from rapid - it\\'s overlong and bloated to extremes. Perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there\\'s only so much you can ask out of a straight-to-video movie airing of Showtime Extreme.Thankfully, there are several laughs, intentional and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas is seemingly a master of disguise, which makes for a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios), and Lance returns in the film\\'s end, albeit for a brief period of time. It\\'s a bad movie, and I probably didn\\'t have to tell you that myself, but it\\'s far from the worst thing I\\'ve ever seen. I wouldn\\'t put it too high on the list of Henriksen films, since he\\'s been in some real gems with greater screen time, and either way the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist begins, but the best thing I can say for Rapid Exchange is that the last two films I watched before it were the mainstream Hostage and the overrated, pretentious Crash - and this was better than both.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is undoubtedly the most harrowing black-and-white war film that I\\'ve watched; as a matter of fact, the only Western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in his work was Samuel Fuller. By the way, I had attended a Kon Ichikawa retrospective at London\\'s National Film Theatre in September 2002, but only managed to catch some of his work made between 1960 and 1973.The film is certainly as depressing as it\\'s reputed to be; however, it also displays welcome touches of black humor throughout - the \\'dead\\' man who wakes up to answer a querying soldier and promptly \\'dies\\' again, the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence, a moribund eccentric telling the famished hero which part of the body he should eat, etc. Incidentally, the script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director\\'s own wife!Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific film-maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often striking - the startling pre-credits sequence (the hero is violently rebuked by his superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a surrendering Japanese at the hands of a gun-toting Philippine woman, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical staff running away to save themselves, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited pace), the automated march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (which also involves the afore-mentioned business with the shoes that, actually, recalls a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT [1930]), a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it, the finale, etc. Surely one of the film\\'s major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape.The film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror movies) but Ichikawa\\'s approach is not only subtle but highly effective: the flesh is actually referred to as \"\"monkey meat\"\", while the hero is seen partaking only once (and promptly spits out the piece along with most of his decaying teeth!); conversely, when the weak underling soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, despite his name, was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) rabidly indulges, the ground nearby is splashed with blood.In the supplements, Ichikawa remembers that Method-practicing lead actor Eiji Funakoshi (whose portrayal is unforgettable, by the way) arrived on the set at starvation point - with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he recuperated! Donald Richie\\'s perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gut-wrenching recent Hollywood fare as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998).FIRES ON THE PLAIN is universally considered to be one of its director\\'s top efforts and, out of the several films of Ichikawa I\\'ve watched, the closest to it in spirit are THE BURMESE HARP (1956; another character-driven war film but with a spiritual tone, and which is also available on DVD from Criterion) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958; which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally, as part of a foreign-film week, a couple of years ago). Personally, I also have a particular soft spot for the director\\'s stunningly stylized color extravaganza, AN ACTOR\\'S REVENGE (1963), which I\\'ve actually caught twice at the NFT in 1999 and the afore-mentioned 2002 retrospective.\",pos\\r\\n\"I am a film directors nightmare... especially of the mega buck, multiplex variety. While not a student of the art I still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film maker\\'s vision, if I can find it. That\\'s why a gem such as \\'You Are Alone\\' is such an exhilarating find. The intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director Gorman Bechard displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people.Spoiler belowI bought the DVD version and have shared it with several people. The reactions have been varied, from disbelief in the ability of Daphne to complete the assignment for which Buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating. As a compulsively skeptical moviegoer I have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or sidled up to and seduced by the filmmaker. This film took the later route for me and by the end I was so involved that I felt Daphne\\'s horror and pain at her role in Buddy\\'s demise. My reaction to this film reminded me of watching \\'The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\\' by Peter Greenaway many, many years ago. By the end I was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too. I\\'ve watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated. I am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of cheeky movies, \\'Galactic Gigolo\\' and \\'Attack of the Killer Bimbos\\' and a mixed bag \\'The Kiss\\' which I recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesn\\'t really represent the directors vision. Too bad, because I loved the prior two films and even found \\'The Kiss\\' interesting but wish \\'The Kiss\\' was available in a director\\'s cut with all of the original vision and music in tact. I look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.\",pos\\r\\n\"I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary.

He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father\\'s creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family members. Louis also has another half-sister Alexandra Tynge from his father\\'s previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis\\' passion was his art.\",pos\\r\\n\"Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully, and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. Irrefutably, all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders from South-Central Las Angeles who go to arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills to skate. That\\'s it.Wassup Rockers is nothing.It has no substance. It has an essentially nonexistent narrative. And, like Kids, it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting. However, unlike Kids, none of them have any semblance of talent. There is better acting in porn. This film features, without a doubt, the most terrible performances I\\'ve ever seen in a feature film. One can respect Larry Clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process, but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy, folks. Might I add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack, which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you\\'ll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater, or you\\'ll regret it afterward.But then again, it\\'s not like they had much of a script to work with. Every line that is uttered is a contrived, pathetically-delivered, and irritating beyond all measure. The story itself is ludicrous. It starts out reasonably enough, but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. This begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clich\\xc3\\xa9d National Lampoonish encounters, characters being killed off for no reason, and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. Shots go on much longer than they need to. Be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight, overlong, lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets. But then again, with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible. Perhaps Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film.Anyways, I could go on like this. This is the worst film Larry Clark has made yet. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. This is by far the tamest film he\\'s made yet, and it\\'s also the worst. It\\'s flat out horrible. Like, Uwe Boll horrible. Definitely the worst one I saw at the festival.1/10\",neg\\r\\n\"Oh how I laughed....this has it all...an Asian/White family, a disabled Asian boy...everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the BBC.What utter tribe: This was a total insult to my eyes that viewed this rubbish for one episode and ONE EPISODE ONLY.When you think of some of the quality the BBC has put out over the years (Fawlty Towers for example) and then this comes rolling in...Its a disgusting disgrace.Its all geared on political-correctness and is devoid of any humour whatsoever.This is straight from the bowels of hell: but what would you expect from the ultra left-wing BPC...I mean BBC.\",neg\\r\\n\"Although I have definitely read this particular Agatha Christie book at some point, I didn\\'t remember anything about it except the name \"\"Abernethie\"\". Which is a good thing, because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer GENIUS of Agatha Christie: the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness. In addition to her stories, the excellent production values, beautiful locations, wonderful music, top-notch acting, elegant directing, etc. are the reasons for this series\\' success and timelessness - and all those virtues are present in \"\"After the Funeral\"\". A word of advice: be alert right from the start - there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence! There are some quite unnerving moments as well, in contrast to the peaceful-looking English-countryside locations, and some small touches of humor. A must-see for mystery buffs, and just a very good film in general. (***)\",pos\\r\\n\"There\\'s a \"\"Third Man\"\" look to the shadowy B&W photography of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, ex-star of Universal pictures during the \\'40s. It\\'s an expertly filmed tale of jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes overly possessive of his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and is soon intent on carrying out a scheme to murder a man she\\'s having an affair with.A taxi-driver (DONALD BUKA) happens to be giving the woman\\'s lover a lift to the hotel when he steps outside a moment to chat with a worker digging up the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to muffle the sound of the bullet he puts in the head of the passenger from outside the back of the car. When Buka returns to his cab, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat.Enroute to report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to switch identities with the dead man who has an American passport which means Buka could realize his ambition to return to the United States. The stolen identity plot becomes thicker when the man\\'s girlfriend (Lederer\\'s wife) shows up at the hotel to accuse Buka of impersonating the dead man.It\\'s the sort of plot movie-goers have probably seen countless times, but it gets a nice workout here, with plenty of tense scenes as Buka and Lederer\\'s wife plan how to run from the authorities until a final confrontation with the murderer and the police.It\\'s extremely absorbing, well done and holds the interest throughout with some excellent atmospheric photography of Vienna that will remind most movie-goers of \"\"The Third Man\"\".Well worth viewing.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie makes \"\"Glitter\"\" look like \"\"Schindler\\'s List.\"\" Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green-lighting a P.O.S. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. Larry Bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer/director/producer/actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. A vanity project gone south, \"\"Hell Ride\"\" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn\\'t centered on Bishop\\'s feeble attempts to steal every scene he\\'s in. (Which is virtually EVERY SCENE!) My final three words on \"\"Hell Ride\"\" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.\",neg\\r\\n\"The parallels between this film and \"\"Captain Walrus\"\" (an independant film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in 1994) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for \"\"Sally Marshall Is Not An Alien\"\" must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work.In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen respectively) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour Britney (played by Louise Farley). As the two boys watch through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis in Captain Walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys.A critical success at the film festival, the plot of Captain Walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the Australian Film Community another notch on the belt with regards to children\\'s product. Although Sally Marshall is not an Alien is a fine film, and a credit to its producers, its inauthenticity leaves something to be deserved.\",neg\\r\\n\"This show had a promising start as sort of the opposite of \\'Oceans 11\\' but has developed into a shallow display of T & A. Actually, according to my little brother thats the only good part of the show. The first season was by far the best, it was new and interesting things just went downhill after that. The only redeeming point of this show is JamesCaan, The other actors are lack-luster. The characters lack depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish nd generally un-likable people.

But my own Extreme Erotica (c) films are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times of this films budget! The story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book... Or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments... Then did the main male character - Klaus Kinski - not look a bit like the second Master of \"\"O\"\" he try to play... And not even lovely Arielle Dombasle, did look delicious in any scene!\",neg\\r\\n\"Having watched this film years ago, it never faded from my memory. I always thought this was the finest performance by Michelle Pfeiffer that I\\'ve seen. But, I am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received. After seeing it once more today, I still think it is powerful, moving and couldn\\'t care less if it is \"\"based loosely on King Lear\"\".I now realize that this is the greatest performance by Jessica Lange that I\\'ve ever seen - and she has had accolades for much shallower efforts.A Thousand Acres is complex, human, vibrant and immensely moving, but surely doesn\\'t present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or \"\"sexiness\"\". I don\\'t think this is well received in these times.Perhaps one reason for this film\\'s underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer (Jane Smiley(, screenplay (Laura Jones), and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. I know that, in my younger days, I wouldn\\'t have read a book written by a woman. I didn\\'t focus on this fact until years later.If you haven\\'t seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past, try watching it anew. Maybe you are ready for it.\",pos\\r\\n\"Since the characters begin with \"\"Unknown\"\" identities, they not identified by name, so you start with handsome James Caviezel waking up in a warehouse. He finds out the place is locked up tight. Don\\'t ask - the windows are made with security glass, and it\\'s impossible to get out. Four other awakening men make it a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his \"\"Jean Jacket\"\", Barry Pepper in a \"\"Ranger Shirt\"\", Greg Kinnear with a \"\"Broken Nose\"\", Joe Pantoliano as a chair \"\"Bound Man\"\", and Jeremy Sisto shot and \"\"Handcuffed Man\"\". Oh, Man\\xc2\\x85 These five men have collective amnesia. They think that three of them are kidnappers, and two are victims - but, they don\\'t know who is which or which is who. The forgetfulness is due to a pipe leak. Don\\'t ask - it happens. Meanwhile, on the outside, lead lawman David Selby (as Parker) sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the men\\'s wives, Bridget Moynahan (as Eliza Coles), frantically waits. But, criminal element\\'s gang leader, Peter Stormare in \"\"Snakeskin Boots\"\", is also on his way to the scene.Like the DVD synopsis says, \"\"As secrets are revealed and clues unraveled, (the five men) must race against time to figure out who is good and who is evil in order to stay alive.\"\" This story reads a lot better than it looks on film, unfortunately. When the secrets are finally revealed, and memories become clear, there is no longer much interest in what has happened. Simply, director Simon Brand has a great premise with Matthew Waynee\\'s idea, but they encumber light investment in the characters holding the short end of the stick.**** Unknown (11/1/06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby\",neg\\r\\n\"Alistair Simms inspired portrayal of Miss Fritton transcends drag.

He will have a hard job competing with the master - or should that be mistress? - Alistair Simms.Go and rent it - it beats so much of what today goes for comedy.\",pos\\r\\n\"A blaxploitation classic, this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the \"\"toasts\"\" that Rudy Ray Moore performs. Toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point, and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap. For more on toasts, Rudy Ray Moore, and why this movie is important, go to Dolemite.com.Which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself. This movie packs in a great deal of \"\"laugh-at-the-funny-outfits-and-hairstyles\"\" bang for the buck, as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue. It starts as Dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice. I was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence, but that\\'s me, I\\'m a neophyte in the prison scene. He is helped in this by Queen Bee, who is Dolemite\\'s lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while he\\'s been gone. She has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters.I watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it provided an interesting contrast. The first part I watched on my lunch break while exercising, and wasn\\'t enjoying it much at all. It struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation, with a ludicrous story, shoddy craftsmanship\\xc2\\x97well, I guess that makes it sound like it had SOME craftsmanship\\xc2\\x97and tons of outrageous locales, outfits and dialogue. But I wasn\\'t enjoying that\\xc2\\x97in fact, it kind of made me feel dirty. Let\\'s face it, a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist: how ridiculously those black people dress, what silly things they say. I wasn\\'t really enjoying it, wasn\\'t laughing, and wasn\\'t looking forward to watching the rest.Later that night, when I was in a \"\"much more relaxed state,\"\" I watched the rest\\xc2\\x97and legitimately loved it. Like Disco Godfather, which I had watched a few days previously, this has a warmth and sweetness at its core that makes it likable even when it\\'s silly or violent. The character of Dolemite has an element of self-parody about him that makes the whole thing fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we\\'re watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together. Even the poor dubbing, karate fights, and everything else just makes it that much more charming.What I find interesting about the Dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity I don\\'t see in other blaxploitation films, and certainly in very few mainstream films. In this one, there is an African-American woman who gives a speech about the (white) Mayor, saying \"\"he has done more for the black community than anyone.\"\" We later find out that the Mayor is, surprise, corrupt, but I like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to \"\"redeem\"\" her in some other way. There\\'s also the figure of the Hamburger Pimp, who is presented as a useless junkie, and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming, socially positive angle to what he is, he just is. In Disco Godfather the religious character Lady Reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child, hopelessly lost to angel dust. I like that the films would present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar-coating or trying to redeem them to make them more palatable.There are a lot of hootworthy elements, such as when Dolemite says \"\"Move over and let me pass, or I\\'m gonna be pulling these Hush Puppies out your muthatf** a**.\"\" There is Queen Bee reaching over and answering the phone: \"\"Dolemite\\'s Total Experience.\"\" And you will not be able to miss (though you may wish to cover your eyes) the extended nude scene by the REPULSIVE Mayor. I am all for mustachioed pervy older men, but even I have limits\\xc2\\x97-and my limits are usually a few miles past most people\\'s, so be warned. The DVD I had is clearly edited, which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes, and at the end, when Dolemite\\'s killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event.If you do get the DVD, however, be sure to watch all three trailers for the Dolemite films, as they are a hoot. I wasn\\'t going to watch The Human Tornado, but after seeing that trailer, you\\'d better BELIEVE that I am. Also, there is a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I don\\'t remember from the movie when Dolemite swings at a Mexican-looking thug, obviously misses, and the guy flips himself into a nearby car trunk.After watching the first half, I was going to say to skip this and watch Disco Godfather, as the film-making and story has marginally improved, but after really enjoying the second half, I would advise watching this one over Disco Godfather, as this one is even more exuberantly fun, outrageous, and good-natured\\xc2\\x97and has those toasts which, even if one doesn\\'t understand the roots and nuances of the form, are still something to see.--- Check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com\",pos\\r\\n\"This should have been a short film, nothing more. The Length of 1,5 hours is much too long, because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke. It\\'s getting more and more on your nerves untill you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie.To do yourself a favor, don\\'t mention to see that movie...\",neg\\r\\n\"The lines in the title of this review are the first lines in this film\\'s theme song, a wonderfully demented parody of the (in my opinion horrible) song \"\"My favorite things\"\" from \"\"The Sound of Music\"\". And this fun little detail isn\\'t the only aspect that makes \"\"The Body Shop\"\" aka. \"\"Doctor Gore\"\" (1973) recommendable to my fellow Gore/Trash fans. The film, which was created almost entirely by J.G. Patterson Jr., who served as producer, writer, director and leading man as the eponymous Dr. Gore, is crap, no doubt, but it is also beyond doubt that it is amusing, and that everyone involved, probably Patterson especially, was aware that they were not exactly making a masterpiece.Dr. Brandon (Patterson) a famous but totally insane plastic surgeon, looses his beloved wife Anitra, a model, in an accident. Along with his hunchbacked assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he henceforth kidnaps beautiful young women in order to build himself a new, perfect wife out of their body-parts...\"\"Doctor Gore\"\" is doubtlessly a film of the \\'so bad it\\'s good kind\\', but it is also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness. Mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite Horror topics, and, as a matter of fact, it is also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous Gore Trash flicks. Obviously shot on a minimal budget, \"\"Doctor Gore\"\" pays some homage to the \"\"Frankenstein\"\" films, especially James Whale\\'s masterpiece \"\"Bride of Frankenstein\"\" (1935), and resembles the look of the early Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore flicks such as \"\"Blood Feast\"\" (1963) - only that this looks a lot cheaper and crappier. Obviously J.G. Patterson\\'s motive was not merely to make a fun gore flick: Being a rather ugly, weird-looking fellow, his role of Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to make out with a couple of hot, scarcely dressed young women (who would later end up as body-part donors in Dr. Brandon\\'s laboratory).Most of the gore is actually pretty well-made regarding the obviously tiny budget. The dialogue includes some extremely hilarious lines (\"\"Get that, it might be the door... and put a coat on so they don\\'t see you\\'re a hunchback.\"\"). Besides the aforementioned theme song, \"\"Doctor Gore\"\" also includes a wonderfully crappy appearance by a country band called \\'Bill Hicks and the Rainbows\\' - my new favorite band, NOT. For the rest of the film, I kept wondering whether Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who plays the hunchbacked assistant, are twins or even the same person - the two look exactly the same, and having two unrelated obese, red-bearded guys looking this weird in one film would be a huge coincidence. Other than J.G. Patterson, most of the cast members never did any other films. This is the first film I\\'ve seen out of the few by Patterson. Sadly, the man died of cancer in 1975.Overall, \"\"Doctor Gore\"\" is a film that certainly isn\\'t for everyone. As a matter of fact, it is total crap. But it is also amusing, and recommendable to my fellow fans of weirdness and cheap camp stuff. Dictionaries should show a screenshot from this film under \\'trash flick\\'.\",neg\\r\\n\"I honestly expected more from this movie. That may have been the problem. There was not one time when the camera was still - ever. On close ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and I get a headache. The cuts are so often and so fast, that the viewer often finds himself/herself wondering what just happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on, they end up losing. To me, this was a basically terrible movie, wrecked by a camera man with ADHD, and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot.\",neg\\r\\n\"I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director\\'s new movie After Sundown. The first time that I saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not take it any more I busted out laughing right in front of the guy. The movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (Female Nudity) was nowhere to be found. I am a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was just too much for me. The worst part was that I had to watch it so many times. Also do not expect the new movie to be any better.\",neg\\r\\n\"Enigma is a computer part which scrambles Russian messages, so that America can\\'t understand them. They can only be read by the intended recipient. The Americans know that the Russians are going to transmit a message revealing the plans of five political assassinations they want to carry out.So they send in former defector Holbeck (Martin Sheen) to grab the scrambler and substitute a false part, so they\\'ll be able to decode the message, and block the assassination attempts.However, as we listen in on the Americans heads of the spy organisation, we find that they already have the scrambler, and they want Holbeck to try to steal Enigma, only to convince the Russians that they don\\'t already have it. They don\\'t expect Holbeck to succeed. That way the Russians, who had stopped transmitting with Enigma, just in case, will begin transmitting again.Enigma is in the computer in the office of Dimitri Vasilikov. Somehow Holbeck must gain access, and in order to do that, he must find out when Vasilikov will be out. He sends in his former girlfriend Karen (Brigitte Fossey) to seduce Vasilikov, so that she can look through his papers and find out his scheduled movements. Karen is glad to do it, as they tortured her father, a university professor, to death.Because we know that it\\'s better for the Americans if Holbeck fails, the movie becomes even more intense as a spy thriller. We find ourselves hoping he can survive against the odds, especially as he uses ingenious methods to beat the Russians at every turn.But what\\'s this? Are Karen and Vasilikov falling in love? Will Holbeck win Karen back, or will she actually end up with Vasilikov? The romantic twist lifts this spy thriller, already worthy of a ten, even higher, for its originality. The writing, the direction, and the acting all combine to make this new and fascinating twist a compellingly realistic one.You find yourself at the edge of your seat, gripping your armchair, not only for the excitement of the spy story but for the intensely beautiful romantic love story as well. The two themes are interwoven perfectly, right up to the end. You really want both sides to win. So who does win, in the end? You\\'ll have to see the movie and find out, won\\'t you!\",pos\\r\\n\"This is, without doubt, one of my favourite horror films ever! I really cannot believe that it didn\\'t gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual Wes Craven sequels and copycat horrors, Mute Witness has all the style, suspense and quickfire plot twists of a Hitchcock/DePalma movie, coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot. It never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is.The plot centres on Billie Hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a Russian factory. By a series of events, she finds herself accidentally locked in, and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie.One of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made. As the main character is mute, she cannot make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie, and a curse in others.The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well, Even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both Hitchcock\\'s \"\"Psycho\"\" as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes.While the acting can be hammy at times, the whole film does hold it together, not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end.All in all, a hugely overlooked, well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which I would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual Freddy/Jason/Scream/Michael Myers/Damien regurgitation\\'s at hallowe\\'en.\",pos\\r\\n\"I just watched this short at the PlanetOut Movies. Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad, little movie about two brothers that are in love. There is some great, subtle acting from both the male leads. Often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story. Luckily writer director James Burkhammer does not do this, and instead lets the story play out with honesty. The sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet.\",pos\\r\\n\"Or maybe not. Whatever anyone thinks of \"\"Broadcast News,\"\" good or bad, almost all the credit for that \"\"thinking\"\" belongs to writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to savage an entire business -- in this case, the \"\"business\"\" being television news -- but to do it with a smile, a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do all that takes real talent, something Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance.One user on this website, in his summary, asked the musical question -- \"\"Did Walter Cronkite act like this?\"\" Answerve: No! Of course not! And the reason for that is in Walter\\'s -- uh, Mr. Cronkite\\'s -- day, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people. Same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay lip-service attention to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. But all they REALLY cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF.Now, of course, all that has changed. For the last 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that has really mattered is ratings, ratings, ratings. The bottom line. How many bucks will our news division deliver for the network? Don\\'t believe that?Let\\'s consider \"\"The Big Three\"\": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (aka \"\"Stanley Stunning\"\"). All three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15-20 years (Peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job). Of the three, Dan is the one with the greatest in-the-field training as a reporter. Personally, I think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions. All of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually IN those jobs. All three are now in their 60\\'s (Dan is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very good looking. And if you think they\\'re still good looking now, imagine how good looking they were in their 40\\'s, when all three were hired for (let\\'s say, \"\"put in\"\") their current jobs. But do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been \"\"put in\"\" had he looked like, let\\'s say, Fred Gwynne (\"\"Herman Munster\"\"). Or like -- heaven forfend -- ME!!! Not only that, if Dan were retiring tomorrow, a younger (than he is today) Walter Cronkite would not be able to get his old job back. Why? Not pretty enough. And it would matter not a whit that he is, or once was, \"\"the most trusted man in America.\"\" And this is what \"\"Broadcast News\"\" is all about. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few minor things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and knowing stuff. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics, all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty-boy-Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he \"\"flop-sweats\"\" behind the anchor desk. And many other such flawed characters whom you KNOW really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks.\"\"Network\"\" blazed the trail. Eleven years later, \"\"Broadcast News\"\" carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie to savage the business of network \"\"news you can use\"\" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.\",pos\\r\\n\"Doll Master is an example of a lousy horror film, fallen somewhere in the space with it\\'s two not so well established genres, a horror film and an emotional drama film.

Jackson\\'s, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin only makes a cameo appearance, Molloy not only stars but co-wrote and co-produced this flick. I\\'ve been a fan of their for years now (apparently I was the only one laughing during the on-set urination in the first episode of the short lived The Mick Molloy Show), so I went in to this with high expectations. I\\'m happy to say I wasn\\'t disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of the work on this thing there\\'s plenty of his usual trademarks. Phrases like \"\"blow it out your arse\"\" and \"\"these bowls are s***house\"\" are all over the place, aswell as plenty of Winnie Blues being sucked down. It\\'s also the sort of stupid, original story you\\'d expect from someone like him. This is like one of those cliqued, American, sporting comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something. But rather than trying to make a dull American sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport usually left to grey army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this and other sporting type comedies is that this is actually very, very funny. What\\'s even better is that even tho the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old folks game, it\\'s never insulting to the elderly, and it never gets sickeningly soppy or anything. It\\'s just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices. Mick is great in the first real acting role I\\'ve ever seen him in, as is Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them have had a lot of practice...

His character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by Taylor Roberts. Her comprehensive delivery of a simplistic character held the movie together. In this pivotal role, Taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all of the other relationships in the film.\",pos\\r\\n\"In a better civilization, this and many other of the David Suchet movies would be released in theaters. The plots are fabulous (no, I\\'d no clue who had done it, but the clues were all there if I\\'d been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the production values astounding, the acting (from Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds, and of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect, the dialogue wonderful, the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff.One of the pleasures of these Hercule Poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them! Here were have two - the sexy sinuous Megan Doods and the stunning Lysette Anthony.You really can\\'t go wrong renting these - they\\'re just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because it\\'s all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeous.I can\\'t think of movies that stimulate thought more than these Hercule Poirot/David Suchet movies.

However, they aren\\'t in nearly as bad a shape as the script.This movie is one of the un-funniest \"\"comedies\"\" ever filmed.It\\'s painful to see this legendary team, the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures, the twosome that made \"\"The Devil\\'s Brother\"\" (1933), \"\"The Music Box,\"\" (1932),\"\"Pack Up Your Troubles\"\" (also 1932), \"\"Babes In Toyland\"\" (1934), \"\"Bonnie Scotland\"\" (1935), \"\"Flying Deuces\"\" (1939) and so many more gut-wrenching, laugh-til-you-choke classic comedies, in a film such as this.But fighters and ballplayers do it all the time. They stay in the game one season or one fight too many. In this case, while is morbidly fascinating to see Laurel & Hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers, they, too, stuck around for one too many.\",neg\\r\\n\"TOUGH LUCK follows a homeless drifter as he becomes entangled in the underground crime world of deception and chaos. Archie(Norman Reedus) has been released from prison and has nothing to lose. He is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named Ike(Armand Assante) hires him for work. Soon Ike discloses a strong desire for Archie to murder his mischievous wife, Divana(Dagmara Dominczyk), an erotic dancer for the Carnival. Things soon get complicated when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her of the scheme. They become involved in a very steamy affair that leaves little to the imagination of the viewer, after which they soon make a plan. Together they plot to murder Ike, but things don\\'t go quite as planned.I would be lying if I said that this film didn\\'t surprise me. I was, personally, blown away by how good this film was. Upon renting it several years back, I was expecting another clich\\xc3\\xa9 thriller with a lot of the typical elements and themes that are shown in a lot of films of that type these days. Within minutes I was hooked and found myself quite involved with the world of this film. It\\'s the kind of film, much like BUFFALO \\'66, that just sucks you in and transports you into the style and the feeling of paranoia. It is a film that really pulls it off in stunning fashion. One thing I particularly appreciated was how the film depicted it\\'s characters. The film isn\\'t as easy and clear cut as it may appear in the plot summary. These are characters that you actually grow to care about and are fascinated by, including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys. In truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this film. All of the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true-to-life. There aren\\'t many films that manage to accomplish this task as flawlessly as this film does, but it\\'s definitely a film style that I like and I want to see more of from films today. There were quite a few crime films that were like that back in the early 50s, but there hasn\\'t been one as gripping and unique as this ever since! In terms of flaws, I have mostly very minor gripes. The film itself isn\\'t exactly original. However, I doubt that most folks would expect it to be original. The film\\'s editing style also may be irritating to some folks as it tends to have a camcorder type of shaky cam throughout. While I wasn\\'t bothered by it and actually felt that it added to the atmosphere, I\\'m sure most viewers will not be as enthralled by it and may find it generally off-putting. Despite the minor flaws, however, this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. It\\'s so refreshing to get lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good. It seems as if this film was a direct-to-video release, though this film is far better than that. Had it been put in theaters, it wouldn\\'t have won any awards nor would it have been seen much, but it would have a lot more recognition than it has today. Recognition that this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is an astounding, entertaining, and twisted neo-noir thriller with a real sense of class and style juxtapose and with enough substance to make the average moviegoer more than simply satisfied.\",pos\\r\\n\"VERY memorable comedy. It\\'s fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world\\'s largest honky-tonk) - the great American Freeway. Like \"\"...mad, mad world\"\" it\\'s got loads of contemporary talent, old-boy politics, good comedic action and dialog. Unlike that one it is the target that seeks, not the unwitting seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they drift along America\\'s great road. Nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly-laugh. But the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing, humor and timing, and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular. The total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling. The slapstick is funny, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed. All in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are, good or bad, and the goofy situations we find ourselves in. It was just meant to be FUNNY and it is!\",pos\\r\\n\"In my opinion, Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful to his dancing partner, tried to upstage everyone and had no awareness of the spirit of Riverdance. It\\'s well he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male lead, is superb, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! Eileen Ivers\\' fiddling is astonishing (as is Noel Eccles\\' percussion,) and Maria Pages\\' \"\"Fire Dance\"\" is worth the price of admission! When Pages and Ivers get together, near the end of the show for a musical duet, well, it\\'s a genuine treasure. I agree, the editing isn\\'t complimentary, but no technical shortcoming can quell this extraordinary tour de force. This is the one to get. There\\'s never been anything like Riverdance!

As expected, things are going to get weird; when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams the beaches scouting out nice looking party girls to make his slaves.

If one has seen his BBC masterpieces \"\"Cullodden\"\" and \"\"The War Game\"\", one will recognize the style (and his voice) within seconds after the start. Made in 1971 it is set in a very near future, when the Vietnam war has escalated even more and now seems to involve China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with violently using drumhead tribunals (outwardly civilian with \\'everyday citizens\\' as judges). Because \"\"prison building can\\'t keep up\"\", an alternative is introduced: The Punishment Park. Delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunt in a hostile environment, in this case a 85 km trip through the Californian desert at 100\\xc2\\xb0F. If they reach an American flag at the end without being caught by National Guard or Riot Police, they will be set free, or else they have to serve their sentence (or be dead, as we will see). The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a tribunal and the course of two groups already sentenced. Scenes jump between the tribunal tent, the hunting troops and the hunted condemned. Watkin\\'s scarce off commentary gives us raw background information (time, temperature etc.). The tribunal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one side and a wide range of personalities on the other ranging from real terrorists over \\'undesirables\\' to clearly innocents (e.g. a total pacifist who can\\'t even hurt flies). The defense lawyer (who does take his job seriously) has to take abuse from both sides. What makes these scenes especially eerie is their resemblance to the rhetoric of todays administration to the detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that the \\'rules of the game\\' don\\'t really apply. The question remains open, whether it is rigged from the start or arbitrariness by the troops due to those events that leads to the outcome (I suspect, it is both). At the end we are back at square one with the next group going to \"\"Punishment Park\"\". This description may indicate a heavily biased (or even demagogic) propaganda movie but that would be misleading. The behavior (all participants were nonprofessionals as usual with Watkins) looks and sounds real (the tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real contemporary trials). I\\'d say that this could be sold as the \\'real thing\\' without problem. With Watkins\\'s \"\"The Forgotten Faces\"\" the reaction was \"\"We can\\'t send that or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore (because this is indistinguishable from the real thing)\"\". With \"\"Punishment Park\"\" it ought to be the same. Effectively banned in the US as far as I know this is a must see that hasn\\'t lost its power or its relevance (especially today).\",pos\\r\\n\"I was in my mid teens when I saw this movie, and I was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. It amazes me to learn that Alvina has recently died, that Bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years, and that both would be in their 50s.The Elton John soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion. I have seen the movie poster, billing it as \"\"Deux Enfants Quis\\'Aiment,\"\" which apparently means something like \"\"Two Children Who Like Each Other\"\"--the English language distributors were wise to abbreviate the title!Paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an English businessman living in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. The two take what they intend as a day-long holiday to Michelle\\'s late father\\'s rural cottage, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant, and they have the baby alone at home. After the baby\\'s birth, the police come to Paul\\'s work place and take him away.\"\"Blue Lagoon\"\" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise. So sad that \"\"Friends\"\" has never been released on DVD.\",pos\\r\\n\"Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? My eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. My ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. Then my brain almost melted because of this film\\'s complete lack of intelligence. It\\'s formulaic every step of the way. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the \"\"dreams can come true\"\" schtick? Show some more faith in the children\\'s intelligence please. Next to Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of Bluth\\'s worst.\",neg\\r\\n\"I heard they were going to remake this French classic in 2007, and I see it is in development for 2011. This will be a shame, as Hollywood kicked writer/director Jules Dassin out because of the infamous blacklist. They should not have the right to remake any of his films.I love \"\"caper\"\" films and \"\"film noir,\"\" and this combines the best of both.Tony (Jean Servais) gets out after doing a nickle, and after he beats up his old girlfriend (Marie Sabouret), he plans a big score with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo (Carl M\\xc3\\xb6hner), What makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery. You see that reflected in the George Clooney Vegas capers. Nothing is left to chance.The caper goes off great but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset after Tony and the gang. After blowing it with Mario, they kidnap Jo\\'s son. Lots of bullets fly before it is over.A great film by a great director. The standard by which other caper films are measured.\",pos\\r\\n\"If you saw the grudge, a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect, just worse, a lot worse. This Time instead of being in Japan with all English speaking people we are in Spain with all English speaking people. It is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like Spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot. Oh and a place with swings, cause there\\'s a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them, oooohhh how spooky.This one is terrible in every way imaginable. The acting by the lameinator mom and dad don\\'t help matters at all. Anna Paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but I hate Anna Paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film.There is one good moment in the movie, however, when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to Anna Paquin\\'s character and she doesn\\'t understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out \"\"You IDIOT, you have not understood anything!\"\" lol. Well I happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage. 0 stars.\",neg\\r\\n\"A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world, have not gone extinct...yet. The survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white, and yellow suits, fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters.\"\"Planet of the Dinosaurs\"\" is a peculiar movie. Like I said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors. The models are crude, but effectively animated. And they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and speaking lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single revision. Obviously, most of the budget was put into the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there\\'s not nearly enough to save us from our boredom. These human characters are only there to scream, run around, and mutter these poorly-written and verbose speeches about survival. And unfortunately, not nearly enough of them get eaten by the dinosaurs.Overall, \"\"Planet of the Dinosaurs\"\" is not a film I plan on seeing again. Some people will simply love it for being so cheap and so poorly made. Sometimes, I enjoy movies like this. But this particular film is just too long, too boring, and very exhausting on the mind.\",neg\\r\\n\"This would have to be by far the greatest series I have ever seen. I vividly watched every sunday night and purchased the box set as soon as it was available. this is a timeless play written by a fantastic Australian that people of all ages could relate to, whether they are Australian or not, however for those of us that are Australian it truly brings across the typical Australian icon. A must see 10/10\",pos\\r\\n\"I hope this isn\\'t a portent of things to come. High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I wouldn\\'t swear that\\'s what was used here), so it\\'s open season for all the wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos.There is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker, and calling it a \\'film\\' would be doing the industry a big disservice. The photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. What\\'s remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals.What hooked me was the title. I\\'m a sucker for this sort of thing, like Frankenhooker, or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was pretty bad, too, but at least I got some laughs out of it, and the acting was merely bad, not awful. I can\\'t comment on Monsturd as I\\'ve yet to get hold of a copy of it.Anyway, I hope the people who made this didn\\'t make any money from it. Else they might be encouraged to try it on again. Please, guys, pawn the camcorder and go back to your regular job.\",neg\\r\\n\"As a movie, THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best; good (not great) acting,nice visuals and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enoughto walk out on. But as a car commercial for the new breed of MINICoopers, this film is spectacular!*SPOILERS*Ok, it\\'s a typical heist film with the odd twist (the underwater safe- cracking was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was fairly solid(with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg), but when it all camedown to it, the real \"\"stars\"\" of this picture were the three MINICoopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping,bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory. The audience I wassitting amongst actually \"\"ooed\"\" and \"\"aahed\"\" when Theron\\'s littlered number first hit the screen (strangely enough, neither she norWahlberg garnered the same reaction).The film starts out promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, DonaldSutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as aninteresting and humourous band of characters, with the only realuninspired performance being that of the usually good MarkWahlberg. Why he claims this is his best film I can\\'t imagine; hischaracter is completely one-note, and he plays him so blandly itwas as if Mr. Rogers came back from the dead and was inhabitinghis body. Charlize is fine as Sutherland\\'s daughter, thoughnothing magical. Seth Green\\'s character is perfect and therunning Napster jokes (including a cameo by Napster founder,Shawn Fanning) are hilarious; he and some of Mos Def\\'s earlylines add some much needed sparks of humour. Unfortunately,Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don\\'t get near enoughscreen time.You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away, and thedialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways, but I doubt thefilmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here, so taken as atypical action/suspense flick it comes out alright. Worth seeing oncheap night I\\'d recommend.7/10. Not worth it\\'s weight in gold, but makes for nice fillings.\",pos\\r\\n\"Terrible action movie in which lead Franco Nero exchanges his cowboy hat, gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in DJANGO (1966) for an all-white Ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it! Despite virtually non-stop action, the film is utterly clich\\xc3\\xa9d and unintentionally funny - with a campy villain, to boot, in Christopher George. Susan George (no relation) is the attractive woman with a washed-up husband, Nero\\'s wartime companion, whom the villains are trying to push off her oil-rich land - but the latter haven\\'t counted upon Nero\\'s martial-arts (and stunt-heavy) gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to hire a similarly-skilled Ninja for themselves who, as it happens, turns out to be Nero\\'s deadly enemy (played by Sho Kosugi, who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another!). The climax takes place inside an arena where one-man army Nero \\'eliminates\\' George and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations; the subtle way in which he despatches his nemesis, however, is effectively done.\",neg\\r\\n\"Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, that no good Willie Green and the sleazy mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, slap and pimp his way across the screen. What\\'s the man\\'s name? DOLEMITE!Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies. Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience. Some people call it blacksploitation others call it trash, I call it entertaining. Dolemite was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and a direct to video Return of Dolemite 25 years later.Highly recommended, a definite cult classic! Footnotes, if the film was properly matted on video you wouldn\\'t see the boom mikes. Dolemite was cut to receive an R-rating.\",pos\\r\\n\"Me and a couple of friends went to rent some movies one day, we picked one each and one of us picked Ironheart. Lets just say that from now on, we never let him pick a movie. This movie sucks\",neg\\r\\n\"The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie. There is of course a first time for everything. In many ways, this movie proves that oaters aren\\'t as easy to make as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one who got by with it was probably Sergio Leone, but even his movies lacked that something indefinably innate to our American psyche and panache. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda did help . I can see now why they changed the original title from \"\"Summer Love\"\" to \"\" Dead Man\\'s Bounty\"\". That itself tells me the producers and director didn\\'t have any core understanding about a western other than those standard shoot\\'em up scenes and violent themes. I suppose we can say the same about American directors attempting to make a Polish movie while failing miserably in the process.\",neg\\r\\n\"I like to like movies, but I found nothing to like about The Box. I was interested in the \\'hook\\' of the plot, but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow. Anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something, well I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes.The only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin, and corrupting mankind. I\\'ve heard that story before, and it makes less and less sense every time. It\\'s true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres, but that doesn\\'t make it worth the ticket price.\",neg\\r\\n\"Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films Director Leo McCarey did starring Charley Chase.

Now they can\\'t allow each other to find out they\\'re cheating. That\\'s the preposterous premise of this frantic farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few comic short leads to have a flourishing career long after the silents, is perfect as Charley\\'s long of nose wife. Charley has an awful case of buck teeth, which are quickly dispatched at the dentist\\'s. After a party is raided by police for no other reason then to practice raids, Charley and his wife frantically try avoiding each other at home for fear the alterations in appearances become known. Both have been photographed with their new features at the party. The hilarity back home culminates in Charley trying to teach the no-good-nick cheating with his wife a lesson. The no-good-nick of course is the new Charley, which his wife comes to realize long before Charley teaches a lesson in faithfulness. This is one of Charley Chase\\'s better efforts. *** of 4 stars.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'ve always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz.

How wrong was I! Every single member of the Jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there\\'s nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and that\\'s what we love! I cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myself! Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! Amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. I\\'ve got two things left to say; WATCH IT, and PLEASE God, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!\",pos\\r\\n\"This film tackles the subjects of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, artful, sensitive, and visually stunning way that I was completely transported. It is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women. You\\'ll have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality, in a way that every woman will relate to. I found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging. There was nothing in this film that said to me \"\"low budget\"\" as far as quality is concerned. Nothing. The fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the film\\'s creators. The final sequence during the credits will also knock your socks off. It is a brilliant celebration of Jane\\'s choice. Unexpected and inspiring.\",pos\\r\\n\"For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn\\'t become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film. Owes an awful lot to Sergei Eisenstein\\'s editing technique, but never as coolly detached or \\'scientific\\' as Eisenstein could frequently get. And a great musical score. A magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in American history.One little quibble: it\\'s not clear why the film involves the Mormons, who, as far as I know, were never the pacifists the Quakers and Amish were. This confusion leaves a slightly bitter after-taste.However, the rest of the film is such a feast, this is easy to ignore. In all other ways, a true masterpiece of American cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).\",pos\\r\\n\"I liked this movie. I saw it to a packed house at the Toronto International Film Festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well. The director, Gavin Hood was supposed to be present for today\\'s screening, but alas his twins were born just hours before, so he had to jet on a flight back. \\'2 birthings in 24 hours\\' was how he joked about it.Rendition refers to \\'extraordinary rendition\\' -- a term whereby suspected terrorists in the US can be sent, without the legal consent of their parents nations, to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained.It\\'s fairly predictable -- innocent Egyptian-American man wrongly accused of being a terrorist \\'goes missing\\' while en route from South Africa to Washingon DC. He is sent abroad, while wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) fights to find him and free him. But what makes this movie special are some nice choices in story-telling: 1) a human-touch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bomb-detonated; 2) the humanity of a CIA agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on; and 3) the chronology of story-telling which makes it a tight, taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments. Ah -- relief! And a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an ending.All-around strong acting with Meryl Streep as a standout vixen.\",pos\\r\\n\"The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What\\'s happening in South Africa should guide us all. I found it credible, moving and at times upsetting. There were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative. Once again the BBC has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this movie in Santa Monica on Aug. 23 and it has stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of Harry\\'s enigmatic, eccentric, life. And also for showing the flaws and failings of Nilsson the man. Thanks for showing the good and bad, the ups and downs, and for uncovering that amazing BBC footage. The film is also a great showcase of a vast amount of Nilsson\\'s music, really well placed throughout the film. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the music scene of the early 70\\'s. Some reviewer at the Ain\\'t It Cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe it. The film is informative, funny, sad, touching, and full of awesome music. It succeeds on all levels. Really, really good.\",pos\\r\\n\"This might not have been as horribly bad as it was if not for the absolutely awful acting job done by Raymond Wallace! This guy is so bad it wasn\\'t even funny! His character was needed in the film, but why they chose this guy is beyond me. If you\\'re looking for some quality Chinese films.....might I suggest \"\"Raise the Red Lantern\"\"....\"\"The Story of Qui Ju\"\"....\"\"Red Sorghum\"\"......Anything but this! I was surprised at how many people actually rated this highly! Really...the acting by this Wallace loser is so bad it overshadows the other good parts of this film. This was agreed upon by all 6 of us watching this movie last night!Stay Clear of this piece of garbage........\",neg\\r\\n\"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS The ripples in the wake of the first \"\"Jaws\"\" movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond. Movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie: the ocean, deep space, genetics). Although \"\"Jaws\"\" was a milestone in this particular realm of film horror, few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original. \"\"Shark rosso nell\\'oceano\"\" (aka Devil Fish or Red Ocean), is a dutiful follower of the original \"\"Jaws\"\" formula. After several hapless boats and seagoers are brutally murdered by some ocean creature, there is an initial drive to discover the beast, then a failure to study it without horrible results, and a final push to destroy it. Although the filmmakers attempted to inject some fresh life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. This movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing, brittle acting, and cheap scares. The most sickly compelling feature of \"\"Devil Fish\"\" is its cookie-cutter editing. From the onset of the film when 3 different scenes are mashed together, the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility. It appears as if the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music. Furthermore, every cut is an intercut and it would appear as if the editors had never heard of the terms \"\"fade\"\", \"\"wipe\"\", or \"\"dissolve\"\". The impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins. Silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time-lapse image of their act is composited over their bodies. The music is equally bland. The creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the \"\"Jaws\"\" theme with slight variation. Although I like to keep my reviews devoid of MST3K influence, Mike most aptly described the somber score as \"\"soft core porn music\"\". Failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to \"\"Devil Fish\"\". The acting is stale, the relationships baffling, and the whole conspiracy is laughable. The question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why couldn\\'t a more practical use be administered to better mankind? One of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster, even though its film presence is less than stellar. Overall, this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre. If \"\"Jaws\"\" had never been made, then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed ineffectively. Sadly, as a carbon copy of Spielberg\\'s original thriller it sits most comfortably on a garbage heap of cheese.\",neg\\r\\n\"I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this film won best of show.SEA OF DUST is a wild romp of Horror, Comedy and beautiful scenery. A back in time tale of strange goings on. An increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people\\'s heads exploding, brings a young Professor\\'s apprentice; Stefan, to investigate. Along his travels, he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love\\'s hand in marriage, only to once again be sent packing by her extremely stubborn father\\xc2\\x85 Along the way \"\"out of town\"\" he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to Dr. Maitland, (brilliantly played by up and coming Vincent Price like actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot. Only the Dr. is insulted that he had called for the Professor and only received a boy in training\\xc2\\x85None the less, Stefan turns out to be much more than a common bystander. Horror Icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger; Prester John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax.Dark Religion and over the top, but fun and sometimes very original, gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the character\\'s reality.Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very Funny movie! Slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. Like others have stated; this really is like three great movies in one. Very Entertaining and Original.\",pos\\r\\n\"WAIT until you\\'ve watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you\\'re ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody\\'s imagination.I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be odd.Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent did sneak through. Ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film.The DVD I rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio section that only featured Sandra\\'s bio - taken verbatim from IMDb. It also had a Trivia Quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. Hope you get them all right!\",neg\\r\\n\"MY Father the hero is sweet, funny and cute. Gerard Depardiu is awesome as Andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen year old daughter Nicole(Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for vacation.While there, his daughter meets a guy named Ben(Dalton James. To impress him, she tells him that Andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her pimp. Everyone on the island is soon under the impression that Andre\\'s a child molester. Andre is between two relationships. One with Isabelle(Emma Thompson, who makes a cameo in the end of the film) and Diana(Faith Prince from Spin City). My father the Hero has many funny moments. Like when he\\'s at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french. So he plays \"\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\"\" from Gigi. Everyone gets disgusted and leaves. My Father the Hero doesn\\'t deserve a 5.1. I think it deserves a 9.0.\",pos\\r\\n\"Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen\\'s tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern (\\'his life is one long party\\'?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. I see I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once again.\",neg\\r\\n\"\\'Blade\\' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren\\'t for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole \"\"Yes!\"\" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI \\xc2\\x96 even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another \\'Matrix\\' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe \\'The Matrix\\' copied \\'Blade.\\' At any rate, it\\'s a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or \"\"day-walker\"\" and his accomplish, Whisler (a la \"\"Batman and Alfred\"\") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade\\'s more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It\\'s not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what\\'s coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 \"\"suntan lotion\"\"? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn\\'t that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is by far the worst non-English horror movie I\\'ve ever seen. The acting is wooden, the dialogues are simply stupid and the story is totally braindead. It\\'s not even scary. 2 out of 10 from me.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is an important historical film since it was the the first all-talking feature film. The film was made for a mere 23,000 dollars.It grossed over a million dollars upon its release. This film all so helped define the gangster melodramas that were to become the bread and butter of the Warner\\'s studio in the 1930\\'s. The popularity of this film ended the silent era more so than its more famous part-talkie predecessor, the Jazz Singer. The film deserves its place in history and not as a mere footnote. The only actor who might be remember today that is in it was Eugene Palette.\",pos\\r\\n\"The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. I am not saying the script was bad in any way, I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don\\'t think it was the script writer\\'s fault. The film did suffer from being overlong, and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes. The film does look beautiful, with some good direction and excellent performances. All in all, watchable certainly, but maybe more for an older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.\",pos\\r\\n\"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Well, seeing as I am a major H:LOTS fan, maybe I liked the movie more than normal people would. However, this movie is still excellent. It had tons of surprises, and it gave some more closure to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer, the overall feeling I felt was satisfied.\",pos\\r\\n\"A very accurate depiction of small time mob life filmed in New Jersey. The story, characters and script are believable but the acting drops the ball. Still, it\\'s worth watching, especially for the strong images, some still with me even though I first viewed this 25 years ago.A young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things (tries to) but these things keep going wrong, leading the local boss to suspect that his end is being skimmed off, not a good place to be if you enjoy your health, or life.This is the film that introduced Joe Pesce to Martin Scorsese. Also present is that perennial screen wise guy, Frank Vincent. Strong on characterizations and visuals. Sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish, but a great story.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is my favorite horror film, a close 2nd to \\'Poltergeist\\'. I saw \\'One Dark Night\\' when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where I worked.I was born in 1963, so I have a certain love for \\'80\\'s horror films, despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written. What I thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of \\'psychic vampirism\\' has not been addressed (at least, to my knowledge at that time) and is a very real phenomenon.I didn\\'t care if Adam West was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but thought Meg Tilly was good casting. The little-known Donald Hutton (from \\'Brainstorm\\' and \\'Invaders From Mars\\') as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on Ramar\\'s abilities was sadly overlooked. As a gay guy, I was paying more attention to David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly\\'s unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend. He\\'s selling real estate in Texas now. I felt the film \\'realistic\\' in two ways: Raymar, who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment, had a funeral that was sparse in attendance, reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious, a hermit, but a killer. As you know, these types are buried without fanfare. Second, if corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile, they would hover, dragging their feet. The filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking, groaning, arms out-stretched zombies, but opted for what would be believable. Kudos! The buzzing electrical discharge from Ramar\\'s eyes at his \\'throne coffin\\' (like he\\'s overseeing his kingdom of dead), cast an eerie magenta light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you\\'ve ever gone to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows. Don\\'t get me started on the cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric, perverted old man. The score was one-of-a-kind and memorable, and I keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out. The track shooting was done where it was supposed to be. I especially liked the carefully-planned characteristics of each corpse: the bride, the badly decomposed child still holding its teddy bear, the grandmother, the tall thin black guy, and the half-faced World War II vet, and the green-slimed eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the \\'Sisters\\' clique initiators. Even corpses can be good actors, I suppose. The only thing I had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke Julie\\'s boyfriend couldn\\'t possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on it\\'s stomach and feet first, but why? It looked a little to fresh too.The film begins eerie, with us never seeing Ramar\\'s face (until the last quarter of the film, which is like unwrapping a birthday present) as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughter\\'s psychic flash. We then see coroners hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see he\\'s experimented his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes into his wall. The rest does drag as the Heathers-like \\'Sisters\\' group baits Julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed build up to the unleashing horror later. The movie isn\\'t bloody in any sense of the word. The goriest part is when Ramar\\'s daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him, and he bubbles then melts. I\\'ve always felt that a power like Ramar\\'s could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into. I can see it now: One Dark Night II: Turning In The Grave. But let\\'s face it-The film stands alone. I heard the film had other titles, but the original fits.A remake would be pointless. But if there were to be one, I would write better dialog, and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on Ramar\\'s abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. In this information age, something like that would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when Ramar\\'s power could spread to the graveyard too? Let\\'s just say I\\'d hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that too can be shown. I think having one of the initiating Sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character. With CG effects, some awesome scenes with Ramar animating cremated remains would be off the wall! Say what you will about,\\'One Dark Night\\' but it has it all. So see at least once in your life...or death!\",pos\\r\\n\"Larry Bishop, the Writer/Actor/Director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. The film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film\\'s start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. The hell with the ride. The film is a bomb.The Victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the revengeful leader of the pack. The Gent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal, but mysterious. Deuce, performed by David Carradine, should have passed on the ride, and so should the ticket-buyers (if you decide to see the film, you\\'ll be sorry, but you\\'ll find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a lewd and venomous character, completely filled with disdain.What puzzles me is how this film, with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity, ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere. Ticket-buyers, take my advice: don\\'t pay for the ride. Please don\\'t make the same mistake as the investors.The first fifteen minutes, or so, of the movie is confusing and unintelligible. The dialog, which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues, doesn\\'t make any sense. The entire film is hell bent on going nowhere. Poor Dennis Hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. He, too, should have passed on the ride. There are decapitated heads, slashed throats, and nude females wrestling. It is clear that Bishop doesn\\'t know where he is going with the film. He gets entirely lost. But, by the end of the ride, you just won\\'t give a damn. Mama Mia! Stay home. And, by all means, don\\'t take the ride. I rate this film a 1 out of 10, but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero.\",neg\\r\\n\"We rented the movie and it maybe the worst movie ever. The box they had in the video store had a cool looking monster on the cover but in reality the monster was a creature from the black lagoon mask. Awful, awful, awful...you actually might have to rent it it\\'s so bad. It feels like you are watching a bizzare-o home movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be \"\"realistic.\"\" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail. In addition, the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of much great artwork. Don\\'t be fooled by the cover (if you happen to rent or buy this film)-- the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface.\",pos\\r\\nPlot: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and are living the dull life. He has slept around before meeting Alice. She has a lot less experience. She decides she needs to sleep around before marrying. He very reluctantly agrees they should both see other people for a while. At first he is not really into it. His wild days are behind him and he is simply content. Until one day Alice comes back and tells him she made out with some random guy; who of course starts to fall for her. Of course this is a BAD idea which causes extreme strain on the relationship.Good movie. You can see the train wreck coming but still good.Worth a rental.,pos\\r\\n\"I am a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are amazingly clich\\xc3\\xa9d (as are most Westerns of this era), his easy delivery and style really elevate the films to classic and near-classic status. While this film features yet another example of real life Western heroes being exploited after their death by Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the film works well due to him as well as excellent supporting characters. One is the always strong acting of Robert Ryan--an excellent actor who is sadly almost forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes who has one of his best roles as the crusty and very colorful deputy. Here he is more enjoyable than in his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne--mostly because his part is better written and he\\'s given more to do.The plot is pretty much the plot of half the Westerns ever made. There are some baddies who hire a bunch of thugs to run roughshod over the locals and it\\'s up to a do-gooder (Scott) to restore the peace and kill off the villains. However, how the plot is executed is much better than average and due to this the film is still watchable fun. Just don\\'t expect a whole lot of innovation or uniqueness--unless you want to see what might just be Gabby Hayes\\' best performance.\",pos\\r\\n\"Well... What to say.I think i shall start with a confession. I have cried 4 times in my life. once when my dad died, twice due to a girlfriend in high school, and at the end of this film. This film deals with the real confronting issues of 6 school kids, forcing them quite uncomfortably into the open for all the world to see. i have never seen a film that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and i doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes.It starts off with a suicide. at 2:37pm. then without letting you know who it was that died, the story begins to be told from the start of the day. it follows the lives of 6 school kids up until 2:37pm. it interchangeably, and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers, lets you know everything about their lives. their loves, hates, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false confidence, self loathing, corruption and arrogance. the overall outcome of which is a sort of \"\"whodunnit\"\" trying to discover the identity of the suicidal before it is revealed at the end of the film. without spoiling anything i must let you know. do not feel cheated by the ending. it contains a very important lesson.And now a warning. this film is definitely NOT for the faint hearted. Many people actually walked out of the cinema half way through when i saw it. Disgusted by some of it\\'s content. Or perhaps it\\'s that it\\'s sometimes hard to face the cold hard truth of reality. This is what high school is like for many people. i\\'m sure most would agree.\",pos\\r\\n\"I was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here. Boy, are they way off mark! To give this 9 to 10 points and call it \"\"one of the best movies of the 1990ies\"\" is just unjustifiable. The big problem here is lack of pace and a paper-thin plot. It\\'s like slapstick on Prozac. Everything trundles along predictably and listlessly. The plot is weak to begin with -- two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour, witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy -- and the movie never manages to go much further. There are some amusing situations and decent acting, but that\\'s not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie.It\\'s simply a comedy that doesn\\'t get its fat ass off the ground, so why waste your time?\",neg\\r\\nThe daytime TV of films.

This short film displays the absolute highest standard in music video and no-one will ever be able to out-beat this \\'King Of Pop\\' masterpiece!

She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems that a long-ago witch-hunt resulted in her suicide, and she was with child at the time. Unaware of the danger, Jane has recently dreamt of the witch\\'s dramatic death, and Jane\\'s little brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has been more directly visited by her spooky, black-clad spirit, which he calls \\'the lady in black\\'. The group\\'s time at the island inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them, however, the Lady in Black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat (George Stevens). Before long, the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own fate by possessing Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - greed, lust, and the blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, she haunts them one by one in gruesome, horrifying ways. The island location is effectively scary, and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot. It\\'s such a colorful film that it reminds me of Dario Argento\\'s work. The lighting is excellent, and the set decoration is perfectly spooky. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme, terrifying, and unforgettable. The cinematography is great, and it is this that brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins, lingering close-ups that subtly detail Jane\\'s incremental possession, and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films. There are hidden homages to \"\"Rosemary\\'s Baby\"\", \"\"Jacob\\'s Ladder\"\", \"\"The Shining\"\", \"\"Black Sunday\"\", and of course \"\"The Exorcist\"\". She does a great job, and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance. That isn\\'t to say that the rest of the cast disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran performer Annie Ross is memorable as Jane\\'s bitchy mother Rose. Hasselhoff gives it his best, but he is not essentially a film star, and his television persona gets in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is otherwise so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (Blair also played a mother in 2003\\'s \"\"Monster Makers\"\", and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them). Lastly, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch, and she has the most amazing voice and accent. Along with Blair, she was also perfectly cast. But it\\'s Blair\\'s movie all the way. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film hearkens back to \"\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\"\". I think \"\"Witchery\"\" is up there with \"\"The Exorcist\"\", \"\"Exorcist II\"\", \"\"Hell Night\"\", and \"\"Summer of Fear\"\" as Blair\\'s best genre work to date.\",pos\\r\\n\"Utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process. While it is true that the SAT\\'s is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college, what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewing.College admissions officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process. The film is an insult to hard-working high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have applied for. This movie certainly deserves rejection on all levels.\",neg\\r\\n\"OK. On the whole, this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with going\\'s on in the world of physics, and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. If you have read Stephen Hawkings brilliant book \"\"A Brief History of Time\"\" and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts..which i did to a certain extent. Greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way. This is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series.The guest scientists were good. (no Hawking, but i suppose he has his own DVD(s) ) I kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts... (very American weighted here, with a few Brits and one antipodean) I bought the Nova 2 Disc edition (NTSC) and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience.1. The \"\"this is brought to you by..\"\" at the start of EACH part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before It was over was very ordinary.2. Can\\'t be helped I suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the FFW button a few times.3. This disc set was straight from TV..(ie ads, what happen last show for those that missed it, and frequent \"\"goto pbs.org for more ....\"\" )appearing throughout the presentation. (quite unlike BBC material which is unmatched for presentation..Planets, The Blue Planet, etc) My 7/10 is based on content alone. The niggles were there but I got over them. If this had have been done with that classic British accented presenter( you know the one) it would be a perfect Disc set in my opinion.If you have seen this and want more...then I highly recommend Hawkings book \"\" a Brief History of Time\"\"...

I then grew out of it and threw all my old Barney tapes away. So one day as I\\'m flipping through channels, I see that Barney now takes place in a caboose, and I thought \"\"Um huh is this the right show?\"\" Once I realized it was, I freaked. Why did they change the show\\'s setting from a school to a CABOOSE? Ever since then, the show has been absolutely terrible, and the only reason I\\'m giving it a 2 is a) because I\\'m nice, b) because of Riff, and c) because in the old times the show was tolerable.

It\\'s not so much of a horror show, but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients. \"\"Scream\"\" is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors. Notice the \"\"judge\"\", who\\'s about to put on the ax from behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r!!!

But, I\\'d just couldn\\'t bring myself on devoting my time to this show. To have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like \"\"The West Wing\"\" or \"\"Commander-in-Chief.\"\" Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn\\'t act (he was awful in \"\"Early Edition\"\"). It was a pain to sit through this show. With its lack of suspense, urgency, and characters who can actually act, I just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so I would have nothing more to miss.Grade D-\",neg\\r\\n\"I recently attended Sundance as I have often done in years past and was treated to the small pleasures of the edgy little indies, the glut of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark and Michael Polish\\'s \\'Northfork\\' and I remembered why I so fell in love with the movies in the first place. \\'Northfork\\' sweeps across the screen with visionary daring and harkens back to the seminal early work of Terence Malick and the existential landscapes of Antonioni. It\\'s an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths. Suffice it to say it\\'s an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning. It reawakened my imagination and cast an imposing shadow over all the other films I saw this year. It is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most American movies. I plan to revisit this film several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. For it is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery, a haunting work where one can roam the plains of Montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. The cast performs this luminiscent piece with striking conviction particularly James Woods and Nick Nolte who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout the course of their careers. Maybe \\'Northfork\\' will help us find a new wave of American cinema where excellence in craft and writing become more the norm than the exception. See it when it comes your way and take your friends for the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings spurred by seeing \\'Northfork\\' will awaken memories of great movie once seen in your past and now hopefully may be returning with the advent of the Polish Brothers.\",pos\\r\\n\"A ridiculous movie, a terrible editing job, worst screenplay, ridiculous acting, a story that is completely ununderstandable...If God was going to decide if movies should continue to be done, judging by this one, the entire world movie industry would now be dead...A wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who \"\"think\"\" they can make movies.I am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour, and are never introduced to us...\",neg\\r\\n\"Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters (Played by Jason Cadieux who is in for Jason Gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. This is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn\\'t have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It is horrendous to watch and Gossett Jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces:Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do anything as long as he\\'s working. As I look at his post Oscar win. Some of his better movies include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Considering that the latter two movies have him co-starring with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work. Of course Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best post-Oscar win work.* out of 4-(Bad)\",neg\\r\\n\"With the Nazi rise to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930\\'s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a dead-on parody of Hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. The film traces Hitler\\'s experiences in the German army from World War I up to the present day. Simultaneously, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule.Paulette Goddard, Chaplin\\'s wife at the time, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin\\'s Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fits. Henry Daniell is his usual staid self as Garbitsch, chief adviser to Adenoid Hynkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. The film was also nominated for best picture.Chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding Nazi Germany up to that time. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. By the time of the film\\'s release in October of 1940, the war in Europe was well under way with Hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.There isn\\'t much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. Likewise, the escape of both the barber and Schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for Hynkel in order to give Chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish Barber mistaken for Hynkel? Still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. One can also not forget the risks Chaplin took in making his first talking film, an anti-Nazi film, and financing the film himself. ***1/2 of 4 stars.\",pos\\r\\n\"\"\"Summer of My German Soldier\"\" was one of the many TV movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were \"\"Brian\\'s Song\"\", \"\"Sybil\"\" and \"\"Someone\\'s Watching Me!\"\"). It portrays a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) befriending a German POW (Bruce Davison) in WWII-era Georgia. One of the things that the movie shows is that many of the German soldiers weren\\'t really Nazis, but were just drafted. Watching the movie, I got a real sense of how things must have been in the South back then; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? So, I certainly recommend this movie. I believe that it\\'s always important to show the things portrayed here. Occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do quite well. I hope that the movie eventually comes out on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the \"\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\"\" patriarch).\",pos\\r\\n\"This (very) low-budget film is fun if you\\'re a John Krasinski fan, but is otherwise disappointing. At least it was short, so I didn\\'t feel like I had wasted too much of my time. John\\'s scenes are funny enough, but the attempted \\'deep\\' scenes with Lacey Chabert are pretty nauseating. It starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie, but some of the characters are just so outlandish while the others are far too serious that it just falls flat. Don\\'t get me started on the ending. It was totally implausible and didn\\'t even fit with the rest of the movie. I will say that I wasn\\'t bored, though, which is why I rated it above a three. Fans of John Krasinski will enjoy seeing him with a bandanna and stockings around his head, and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and make sure to check out John\\'s deleted scenes, they\\'re better than some that were actually included in the movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being Namak Halal (even though that was technically a drama). Story is nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir\\'s faces. Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual.The plot is rather simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They don\\'t believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man\\'s (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both of them get into Raveena\\'s house, Amar as an injured guy and Prem as his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are complicated as Raveena\\'s friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls for Prem and pursues him. And rich man\\'s evil twin brother (Rawal also) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, its that good. And if you like this movie, I\\'d also recommend Gol Maal if you haven\\'t already watched it. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).\",pos\\r\\n\"Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife\\'s heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O\\'Connor as Minnie Driver\\'s grandfather, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines Minnie as a \\'sister\\' is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with James Belushi as her husband. Classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. Thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times.\",pos\\r\\n\"What offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of \\'originality\\'. This film does not contain ONE innovating element. If, by \\'originality\\' you refer to pathetic action scenes, overacting, gluttony in violence, blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. Then, \\'originality\\' is something Swedish film can do without.How R\\xc3\\xb6se and Karlsson can agree to \\'act\\' in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me. And how Eva R\\xc3\\xb6se after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast-TV promoting it just disappoints me.This film doesn\\'t contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just plain bad. These two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy-fantasy containing violence, comic-strips and trivialized psychological portraits. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if the scene of DD masturbating in the kitchen over a micro-wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors.I wouldn\\'t show this movie to my worst enemy.\",neg\\r\\n\"Bob Clampett\\'s \\'The Hep Cat\\' is a distinctly average cartoon only really notable for the fact that it was the first colour Looney Tune (previously Looney Tunes were all black and white while Merrie Melodies were in colour). The tale of a singing, dancing cat\\'s attempts to woo a lady cat and a dog\\'s attempts to catch the cat, \\'The Hep Cat\\' lacks the trademark energy and pace of most Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett doesn\\'t have a great deal to work with. Warren Foster\\'s script is embarrassingly thin and, while he has spun straw into gold with other cartoons, Clampett doesn\\'t manage it with \\'The Hep Cat\\'. It\\'s often said of Clampett that you can\\'t mistake his cartoons for anyone else\\'s and it\\'s generally true but \\'The Hep Cat\\' is an exception. There\\'s flashes of Clampett genius, such as the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog \"\"Hey, are you following me\"\". When the dog confirms that he is, the cat simply says \"\"Oh\"\" and the chase immediately resumes. Unfortunately, there\\'s very little of such brilliance on show here. Knowing who directed it, \\'The Hep Cat\\' is a bitter disappointment. We all have off days and this was clearly one of Clampett\\'s!\",neg\\r\\n\"A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It isn\\'t relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation.A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie, regardless.Sarkar, I am afraid, was a very poor movie. First of all, just by making characters look dangerous, or macho, they don\\'t bring in an aura about them.What was so brilliant about Nagre(Amitabh Bacchan\\'s character) that we should have been in aura of his \\'power\\' and what showed the \\'benevolence\\' of the character? Nothing.This fact was said by a commentator and Amitabh kept giving facial expressions. Now Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions but why should it mean any thing if there is no history or story to go with it.There wasn\\'t proper charecterisation of the characters who worked under \\'sarkar\\' too. Just because a man had spectacles, why should we assume he is wise. ] The flow of the movie was generally dullbecause scenes from the Godfather were created (like the policeman slapping Abhishek Bacchan), the older brother being killed by Abhishek (like Fredo was killed on instructions of Pacino) but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it. That was indeed the problem.If you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a Godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues, what you get is a highlights show from a cricket match, never making the full impact watching a full match will make.\",neg\\r\\n\"George Barry\\'s \"\"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats\"\" is, at root, a dark fairy tale told via a horror-movie framework. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it\\'s downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without Barry\\'s knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be fed to the bed, ASAP). If you\\'re looking for overt gore or rabid action, \"\"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats\"\" isn\\'t the flick for you. \"\"Death Bed\"\" is a gentler, weirder drive-in picture; it plays like an utterly strange dream, half-remembered. I\\'d recommend reading Stephen Thrower\\'s summation of \"\"Death Bed\"\" in Thrower\\'s FAB Press book, \"\"Nightmare USA\"\" (he describes the movie\\'s vibe perfectly). Whether intentional or not, I\\'ve noticed shades of \"\"Death Bed\"\" in everything from the \"\"Phantasm\"\" films to Michele Soavi\\'s \"\"Cemetery Man\"\" to the magic-realism/slipstream fiction of authors such as Kelly Link.

Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope it will be on at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer and A Gentleman, Jack Webb delivers an unbelievably great performance as a Parris Island Drill Sergeant with the classic screw-up recruit, and the story line in this one, though dated, is touching and very well acted.

His ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague sideshot of something bumpy over and over. It makes no sense, it\\'s horribly boring, and it\\'s conspiracy plot sucks.There are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor slamming a dying patient\\'s chest twenty times with a difibulator without stopping, even though he\\'s clearly dead; the porno-esque soundtrack; the shot of the couple making love on the beach, with three different thems (\"\"That us is getting ahead of us!\"\") doing this; the ancient computer that sounds like Kermit the Frog; a beer-guzzling scientist screaming \"\"I know!\"\" a la Dr. Smith; the list goes on and on.Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie (much noticed by Mike and the \\'Bots) . . .The MST3K version is their best episode, but it\\'s certainly better than the movie itself. \"\"This is how I like to go fishing, guys . . . with a flashlight and a flamethrower . . .\"\" - CrowOne star for \"\"Devil Fish\"\"; seven for the MST3K version\",neg\\r\\n\"Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers ,I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38 , all rated this film a 10. Upon comparison with other great films, these reviewers felt that the Quick and the Undead is a better film than,The 6th Sense(8.2), Saving Private Ryan(8.4), Lord of the Rings( 8.7),Godfather(9.5), Gladiator(8.1) and Dawn of the Dead ( 7.8) to name a few. Hopefully these shills utilize their next discounted lasik procedure, that they hear of, because it is completely obvious that these reviews have been falsified.I was led to believe that this film featured a unique concept in the genre of Zombie film making. Sadly upon watching the Quick and the Undead , It is obvious that these reviews were generated by people who either were involved in the production, or have a vested interest in the films marketability / financial success. Nothing cements this in my mind more than hearing that a portion of this film was shot in Texas, were, coincidentally allot of the early posting praising the film are from. The Zombie film / Horror B movie culture on a whole is a forgiving group, but this film is sadly beyond any redemption. The characters are recycled,and the plot poor.The film quality was not bad enough to be labeled camcorder,and at least they used a film quality camera . The acting is horrible, the star trying unsuccessfully to come off as a Clint Eastwood wanna be clone. Christ on a Bike !!!!!! Even the lead actor\\'s name is Clint. He was just terrible. The only resemblance to Clint Eastwood, is that the lead is using the \"\"wood\"\" from Eastwood\\'s name in his style of acting. The Zombie makeup was above Halloween party quality , but not applied completely to the full undead cast members. Allot of zombies were not made up on their hands. The plot was so hokey that it had me hoping for a power outage, a blemish on the DVD disk, or that the zombies would turn their attention on the director. Maybe the film has worth to some viewers, but not for my hard earned dollar. Luckily I used my free rental coupon to check out this DVD. Maybe this film will be rescued by Nott entertainment ( aptly named) releasing a special collectors DVD, which will tie up loose flaws, and deliver the promised goods??? Some how , I think NOTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Unfortunately, however, when he discovers that his co- workers (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are plotting to take the $42 M shipment for themselves, Ty must fortify himself \\xc2\\x96 and the funds \\xc2\\x96 inside the armored truck.A tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned-in performances, Armored is an utterly forgettable film.Besides, if you really want to jack millions, it\\'s a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an ATM.

Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this one in my mind. I would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His animosity towards playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons. He must adjust to life in Japan (\"\"First you wash, THEN you bathe!\"\") He eventually sees eye to eye with his coach and sets his goals to have that one final season of greatness, though in a much different environment than he ever imagined!

The unfolding of the story, not so much the narrative line but the revelation of the characters\\' inner selves, is masterful.Olivia Magnani, who plays Sophia, the hotel receptionist, who finally breaks down the icy reserve of former consiglierie Titta di Girolami (Tony Servillo) is coolly beautiful and reveals hidden depths and personal honesty in her brief but profound relationship with Girolami.The disgraced Mafia middle-man, forced to live out an empty life, tormented by insomnia, in a Swiss hotel, becomes caught up in the similarly empty lives of the refined older couple who formerly owned the hotel but are now forced to live there as residents after the husband gambled away their resources years earlier. The husband is constantly dreaming about recovering his lost wealth and making a grand statement to the world. His wife realises this is but a pipe dream. This nicely counterpoints the resignation of Girolami who sees no way out and does not seek one.The fleeting love affair between Girolami and Sophia has consequences that no one could have foreseen. It enables him to escape his prison without bars but to pay a huge price that he willingly accepts and in doing so provides redemption for the older couple.\",pos\\r\\n\"David Lynch shot his first film, \\'Erasurehead\\', over several years, adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash. Kevin Smith made \\'Clerks\\' at work, while working as a clerk, and Robert Rodriguez has boasted that \\'From Dusk Till Dawn\\' cost precisely $30,000. But $30,000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. And what if an aspiring film maker not only had such a job but also had all the ambition of such luminaries, and all the dorkishness of Smith, but absolutely none of the talent. Such a figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years. Borchardt combines his lunatic dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day; one senses he almost prefers the endless labours of searching for an impossible perfection to an accommodation with the reality that he\\'s simply (on the evidence presented in \\'American Movie\\') not very good. And like a modern day Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers, his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature. The collection includes his warring parents, his best friends (one a criminal, the other a reformed drug addict), his own hapless children and best of all his aged Uncle Bill. Bill may live in a trailer park, and just about have given up on life, but he is the owner of a small fortune ($280,000 to be precise) and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film. Borchardt manages to enlist a few actors to perform (alongside himself, of course) but in the main he is wholly dependent on friends and family to complete his work (even Bill has a role on camera). On British TV, the BBC brilliantly scheduled a screening of \\'American Movie\\' back-to-back with \\'Lost in La Mancha\\', the story of Terry Gilliam\\'s ill fated attempt to film \\'Don Quixote\\'. In that film, one was impressed by the huge amount of professionalism on display (inadequate as it was to the task in hand), and just how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend to make a film; whereas Borschadt is not only penniless, but also such a clown that he can\\'t even pronounce the name of his own work (\\'Coven\\') properly. Ultimately, Borschadt is human enough for you to want him to succeed, but awful enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures. If this film was fiction, you\\'d dismiss it as unbelievable; but as it is, it\\'s one of the funniest documentaries you\\'re likely to see.\",pos\\r\\n\"I just managed to find a copy of \"\"Mission Cleopatra,\"\" which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the United States.

I see that people on here have said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the subtitled version, that may very well be true, and after I watch the subtitled version (also on my DVD) I may have to come on here and alter my review.

Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Nini\\'s violent boyfriend.

Finally Fran\\xc3\\xa7oise Arnoul as Nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for Danglard, and becoming his girl, is just stunning; her loveliness and pert charm will win you over.A bonus: we get Edith Piaf, Patachou, Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the Moulin rouge.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie had very little good points, the special effects and acting was horrible for sure. But it was a movie made on a low budget so you dont expect much from it, it does have some laughs (I doubt they are intended though :) ). The scene where the old woman bends down and touches dung that was on the floor, then puts it to her nose and goes CHUPACABRA! in a really stupid raspy voice was priceless. All in all if you have nothing else to watch and just want to laugh at a really crappy flick trying to cash in on the Blair Witch Project\\'s success, then grab it other then that dont bother.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie is not that good at all.Its pretty stupid, pretty annoying, and very poorly done.I really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film.Although I didn\\'t hate it as much as them, I still found it to be a pretty bad film.The only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times, and also I feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay.What I mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast, not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival, and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film.Instead it isn\\'t but instead what it is now, a crappy film.The acting is atrocious I felt as if I was watching a couple of teens act for like a Halloween show or Thrill ride or something.The kills are pretty cheap(as is the film itself), and basically everything else is low-class.Overall this film really is bad and you wouldn\\'t be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film.3.8 out of 10 stars\",neg\\r\\n\"Bergman\\'s regular Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann starred as a village couple, Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with an ordinary couple who fights and make up. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who is getting fed up with her husband\\'s lack of ambition. Because Jan procrastinating in fixing their radio, the are oblivious of the impending war. Of course the war arrived, and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and to each other through the invasion as they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government.There were no musical score to the movie, but the soundtrack was the war noise. In one scene the pulsating background gun shot, the explosion, and sound of the fly by planes was incredible. Now and then, Bergman zoomed into the facial expression as different event took places. When something violent happened, he zoomed out to let the audience sensed the violence rather than seeing up close. Very well done movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"If the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:1. Awful 60\\'s hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say DADDY in the most annoying voice imaginable.3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn\\'t mesh with the film. At all.4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. Oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.5. Hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.6. The exterior shots of 5, which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light.7. Terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first Star Trek series look cutting edge by comparison. ( Special mention: The little boy\\'s blond hair glowing. Oh dear..) 8. Laughable editing and continuity, where background items move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc.9. Not got enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get any lady from off the street to prance about like an idiot! No-one will notice the difference! Er..10. A \\'thrilling\\' climax involving quicksand, snakes (more stuff from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. Don\\'t forget to put in a stupid \\'tribal\\' sounding song either!The more sensible among you however, will wait for it\\'s inevitable appearance on MST3K when this classic TV show is resurrected and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended. Any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable.. not to mention unworkable. So don\\'t even try it. 0/10\",neg\\r\\n\"I am not kidding: there\\'s a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a tunnel keystone and explodes (with no fireball, though) into a million pieces! It made some kid in front of me scream in terror! ...In a G-rated film!This film might serve to convince children that Santa Clause is EVIL! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, over-the-top and mean! When Santa (here an anagram of Satan!) appears, all 200,000 elves begin singing \"\"Santa Clause is Coming to Town\"\" as though it were a Druid war chant. Then, in the reflection of this movie\\'s \"\"Rosebud\"\" object (a jingle bell that whispers hints of why you can\\'t hear it ringing: \"\"doubt....doubt...)), old Saint Nick appears, looking like a stoic Donald Sutherland, his face glowing like Moses\\' from \"\"K10C\"\". When we hear him speak, his thundering voice sounds less like a jolly old elf, and more like James Earl Jones\\' voice slowed-down about 20%. Frightening!The syrupy music is out-of-place, boring and repetitive. It doesn\\'t follow any emotional threads (as in \"\"Titanic\\'s\"\" very effective score). It just seems thrown in at certain points in order to generate feelings of warmth and magic. It fails to stir, partly because it doesn\\'t match the imagery of the film. There are some musical train wrecks (no pun intended) where, out of nowhere, the eerie, symphonic score slams abruptly into happy, child-voiced POLKA about the title locomotive. It just makes the whole movie sound like it was rushed into production! Finally, I agree with some other reviewers about how, well... \"\"dead\"\" everyone looks. It does seem a little macabre at times. The motion-capture technique is good for allowing the Kings Island-like roller-coaster train sequences to look convincing from a distance, but up close, \"\"real\"\" actors should have been used. Overall, nice eye-candy for killing time in front of the TV, but not much else here.\",neg\\r\\n\"Having first read the novel, I don\\'t mind,for the purposes of filming, how differently it is scripted, as long as it adheres to, or at least includes, the plot. For reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored, and a different story line added. The reason this novel passed the test of time, is, no doubt, due to the interweaving of both the characters, and plot, as a whole. To interfere with this structure, is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line, and therefore the intension of the story teller. Although a matter of opinion, the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired. Characters, described as very fat, should, at least, be made to look portly, to allow for the character to have credibility. The days of slavery can\\'t be over, or surely, actors of this calibre would have been in revolt, at such a travesty of the story. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as being manly in appearance,... Tara Fitzgerald\\'s very feminine appearance doesn\\'t ring true. Again Laura Fairly is described as being \\'fair\\', if not \\'ethereal\\', so, with dark hair, she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel. ....Badly done, Hollywood!J. Hunter\",neg\\r\\n\"Even though this film was nothing special as such, I am drawn to comment on at least one factor that ruled in its favour - that of the lead female performer in the film, Dyan Cannon. In spite of the film\\'s ridiculous storyline and what she goes through here, hers was the best acting job in the film, making the unbelievable seem more plausible. Her raucous scene with the gay photographer David Hemmings has to be seen to be believed. Good work, Dyan.\",neg\\r\\n\"One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story it\\'s hard to comment on the actual film. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) laid his life open for all to see, I guess he\\'s fair game to criticize. And that\\'s not hard to do. Here goes. 50 something Glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (I guess 11 films makes him a \"\"star\"\") Being gay and forty, I have seen porno and I did not recognize him or his lover. Personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles. Face it, guys, he\\'s no Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. That\\'s OK, though. The purpose of these films takes place in about 6.5 minutes, so they all pretty much have the same requirements, if you know what I mean.So Glen wants to be a serious (legit) singer after he dumps the porno industry but he can\\'t get anyone to take him seriously. I wonder why? Was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film. And according to the film it\\'s not just porn flicks he indulges in, it\\'s living in a house with other \"\"stars\"\" where people can hook into their bedroom, the bathroom and where ever via webcams . It\\'s 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip gigs at clothing optional \"\"hotels\"\". Doing something called meth which I presume is a drug. And then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you ---- because he\\'s \"\"legit\"\" now. Oy!The only interesting, non-cardboard character is the Academy Award winning gay screen writer who wouldn\\'t give his name. And considering this is a documentary, well, porn is as porn does. You can tell he\\'s most amused by the dumb-bunny porn star.Glen has one hyper-nellie manager (Kyle) who wants to \"\"sell\\' him as a porno-participant in hopes of getting him gay-club gigs. He tries to do the Svengalli-routine. \"\"Wear this\"\" \"\"Don\\'t smile\"\" \"\"say this\"\" in what amounts to controlling issues. But our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. That\\'s the first mistake. I\\'m not saying Kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager, they\\'re not going to get far. Kind of like: He who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.All of this wouldn\\'t have been bad if it weren\\'t for one small tiny bit of information. Drum roll, please. He\\'s bad. He sucks. His singing talent ranks up there with Ashlee Simpson. It\\'s hard to root for someone who -- while trying make his dream come true --- at 50! --- doesn\\'t work like normal people. No job. Can you say lazy-ass? And the whining, and the \"\"Why don\\'t they accept me.\"\" song and dance. And after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry, he spouts off, \"\"Why don\\'t I have a record deal by now.\"\" What? Actors are waiters. Writers work in low-level newspapers or mags -- whatever. This guy is above that. It\\'s true. He wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it. Whine. Whine Whine. His lover leaves him to return to nursing but I tell ya I wouldn\\'t want that moron dispensing medical care to me. Both of them were useless. Airheads. The movie is useless. Unless you really like Whine and Cheeesy people stay away. Do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people, there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe.\",neg\\r\\n\"The 13th and last RKO Falcon film starts with the mutual injunction by Tom Conway as Tom Lawrence alias the Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of \"\"No dames!\"\" whilst they prepare to go on vacation. While you\\'re still wondering what they\\'re going on vacation from as they hadn\\'t had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay though and Jenkins as Goldie) they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caper.They promise to help her when her uncle is murdered, by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in Miami. Suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after Lawrence \\xc2\\x96 and Goldie for the murder. To console himself Goldie keeps paraphrasing travel brochures: \"\"On the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cosy electric chair\"\" for one. Some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies. Favourite bit: the dignified game of hide and seek/hunt the thimble the imperturbable and suave Lawrence has with the baddies on the sleeper train. Least favourite bit: the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator wrestling hut \\xc2\\x96 definitely thrown in for the kids!All in all not the best in the series but yet another entertaining outing, with an overall satisfying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few more years as Columbia did with Boston Blackie, although RKO were churning these out faster. Absolutely no sex, not much violence (in fact none at all by today\\'s high standards), and positively no message all make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only regard movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillars.Three Diet Falcon\\'s were made later with John Calvert in the title role, I don\\'t mind them but could never bring myself to count them into the main series, which Tom Conway had made his own by this time. Sad also that it was all downhill after this for Conway, who moved into TV, voice overs and even played Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 rather well in 1953. He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems \\xc2\\x96 I don\\'t know if they were linked \\xc2\\x96 wound up poverty stricken and after a spell in hospital in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriend\\'s bed. For us folk that want to at least we still have his 10 entertaining Falcon\\'s plus a number of other worthy, even classic RKO movies from 1942 to 1946 with which to remember him by.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago, and it is now making a comeback at the local film club. It uses every clich\\xc3\\xa9 in the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook (Beginners Edition) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be. You get your run-of-the-mill slow-motion tempo, brown color scale, slow pans through bombed-out environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic imagery, and the requisite miserable ending.It is a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical Russian art movie. The director, Aleksandr Sokurov, has excellent command of technique, but he lacks eye. He doesn\\'t see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pathetic.This movie is a wet dream for art film haters. It lives up to every stereotypical view of the genre that there is.If it was bad in an entertaining way, it would a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that you walk out afterwards royally p***ed-off, we need a new term. This movie is a Sokurov.\",neg\\r\\n\"**Might contain spoilers**Ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think that? Let me explain. Guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. They do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. After debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved. After deciding they cant trust their bosses, they decide to, once again, steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackers.In theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low-budget movie that just aims to be aired on TV. However, the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts. Firstly, the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes. Second. The acting is really bad, or the actors are directed to act as dummys. There aren\\'t many emotions, change of facial expressions at all etc. I was especially disappointed in Guttenberg that I believe can do so much more, but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action-hero. In addition, though I am not by any means any expert on the subject, I totally believe I could assemble a better covert-ops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week. This seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible. This go for good guys, bad guys and bystanders as well. Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. For example, I have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and I didn\\'t break instantly.Don\\'t know how to conclude this really, but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do. Sorry, can\\'t be any nicer than that. Do not watch this movie, it is not even so bad it is funny. 2/10\",neg\\r\\n\"There are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is. What I wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic separators. If there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both. The first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a scram mechanism. It\\'s a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico.The other thing I really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after Germany surrenders. Okay, we have thousands of (mostly) men who worked for years to make a really big boom. Does anyone think they didn\\'t want to see it work? There was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device, but it was not that serious, clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be.\",neg\\r\\n\"In Strangers On A Train, it\\'s obvious from the start that playboy wastrel Robert Walker has singled out Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders. Granger\\'s a semi-public figure, he\\'s a tennis pro, but not an especially high one. High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman.So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon, Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them, complete strangers, did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise. Though Granger is repulsed by the idea, one of the beautiful things about this film, is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptation.In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot, Granger\\'s wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man, he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walker\\'s father so that Walker can inherit his estate. Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that.Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role, ironically in his last complete film. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either. Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing, first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger.Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best, it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing.\",pos\\r\\n\"i have had this movie, in the back of my head sense i saw it. i have wanted to tell people about it time and again, but never remembered. now i found it. now finally, i can tell people precisely what the absolute worst, most crappy movie i have ever seen in my entire life, bar none is.this movie is complete trash, and is unfit for a garbage dump. all prints and other copy\\'s of this movie should be rounded up loaded into a large rocket, and launched into the sun. only the purifying heat and pressure of the sun might be able to purify the materials this movie is stored on, so that they can be useful to the universe again.i like movies. i like bad movies. and yes this is an opinion. but this movie was pure trash, filth, and excrement of some beast that should never be seen let alone named by man.i would rather watch a Uwe Boll Movie marathon than watch this movie. and i hate Uwe Boll\\'s films.\",neg\\r\\n\"i hired this movie out from my local movie shop, not really expecting anything to flash or fancy. Since it was a \"\"B\"\" grade movie, made on a very tight budget. The opening scenes of the film were rather original and so was the plot and thats what made me hire the movie out. However the film becomes very boring and frustrating at points. The story had plenty of holes in it and the acting had its fair share of disappointments as well By the end of the film i was praying that a higher power was going to strike me down where i laid as i was extremely bored but more importantly frustrated with how the story turned out. i still don\\'t understand what actually happened and i don\\'t particularly care. in conclusion the devil would cry in disgust to know that Hell (his domain ) was used as a basis for such a crappy film.\",neg\\r\\n\"A swedish splatter movie? Has the world gone insane?Probably not, but it\\'s still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore-flicks, the b-movie business in Sweden seems to have troubles these days, long gone are the golden days of \"\"Rymdinvasion i lappland\"\". And this movie seems to have some troubles on its own: it\\'s just too much talk in it, it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good FX, which are great for a b-movie. The script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though, but that actually don\\'t matter that much, it\\'s supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more, that\\'s where it goes a bit wrong for some reason. There\\'s is simply not enough blood to fill the void. Every person who know about Gert Fylking will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt. though. I nearly laughed my ass off. It\\'s really that hilariously bad. Besides the good parts I\\'ve listed there\\'s really nothing else to recommend here unless you\\'re starved for swedish B-movies.4/10\",neg\\r\\n\"This is a poor, poor movie. Full of clich\\xc3\\xa9s, unrealistic moments: punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out, never mind that someone\\'s lost their home and possessions!!, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first, walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment!! Did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something!!? Anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke. It\\'s a pity, because firefighters do an awesome job, and they deserve to have a good movie made about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.\",neg\\r\\n\"Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, and in so doing, clearly drew parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action, and the fateful day when Mishima held an army general hostage and spoke to the garrison, only to have it ridicule him and his Bushido ideals of the samurai code. Mishima committed ritual seppuku on November 25, 1970, and he planned it as a meshing of beauty, art, and action. Schrader edits scenes recreating that day with three different scenarios from Mishima\\'s novels: Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko\\'s House, and Runaway Horses. The moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax via pulling back the camera while simultaneously zooming in. Black and white sequences are intermingled with the colorful moments depicted in Mishima\\'s novels. The black and white scenes represent memories from Mishima\\'s childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that often parallel Mishima\\'s real life, such as his stammer, development of his bodybuilding obsession, and his fostering of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art, and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels. The color sequences are reminiscent of early, stagy Technicolor films, giving the film, perhaps, an intended surreal quality considering the subject matter.Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with unfailing determination, headed to the general\\'s office on that fateful day and resembles the real Mishima. Schrader took tremendous risks with this film in focusing on the novels he did and with tying them thematically to both Mishima\\'s personal life and his literary ambitions. The editing of the film between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the black and white growing up segments, and the colorful novel scenes clearly point to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art, and action in Mishima\\'s life. At times, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.\",pos\\r\\n\"Volcano is set in Los Angeles where a minor earthquake has just hit, vacationing boss of the O.E.M. (the Offcie of Emergency Management) Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to cut his holiday short & go in, once there he sees that everything is alright but then drives off to the epicentre of the quake where seven underground workers have been killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind. Mike isn\\'t sure what to think so he brings geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) in to try & explain things, unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava has been released after the quake & erupts at the La Brea Tar Pits sending the lava pouring out into the city streets engulfing anything & everything it touches in flames. Mike, his men & the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava & save as many lives as possible...Directed by Mick Jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting Volcano during 1997 with Dante\\'s Peak (1997) being released a mere two months or so before Volcano was & while Dante\\'s peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least it\\'s slightly better & more plausible than Volcano is. The script here is total nonsense & is not based in reality at all, underground rivers of lava that seem to appear & then disappear just as quick, various character\\'s standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat (when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine, as far as I am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal, is it?) & it constantly happens, helicopters flying is clouds of ash (in reality it would be impossible), one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava (what about down the other streets & other directions?), being able to blow a perfect trench in a street & then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam & when Kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there & watches two firemen get burned to death & waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire, despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guy\\'s do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through & loads more besides like that massive building falling on Tommy Lee & his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards. The character\\'s are awful too although they were not as clich\\xc3\\xa9d as usual with no romance blossoming between Tommy Lee & Anne Heche & minimal city official\\'s who try to shut Tommy Lee & Anne Heche up before the event labelling them scaremongers. There\\'s a few badly written & at times embarrassing moral moments as Los Angeles pulls together, the black guy & that semi racist cop who warm to each other & by the end are wishing each other well & that little kid at the end when he says \\'everyone looks the same\\' is cringe worthy & is surely a ham-fisted attempt & trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings & we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together. Having said that I think Volcano is one of those so bad it\\'s good films, it entertains & it moves along at a decent pace but just don\\'t expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama either.I suppose a film like Volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70\\'s disaster film such as The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974) but on a huge budget with modern effects work. Speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much & the set-pieces are also surprisingly forgettable, sure there are a few impressive explosions & a few OK river of lava flowing through Los Angeles effects but little else. Generally Volcano just isn\\'t very exciting & while occasionally unintentionally funny & completely ridiculous it doesn\\'t really work in the way the makers intended.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 it opened to a little under $15,000,000 at the box-office, it looks alright & there\\'s lots of fire but nothing stands out & Volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall. Filmed in Los Angeles I think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations. The cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue & ridiculous set-pieces to contend with, Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than this.Volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses, it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself. Worth it for a few unintentional laughs & the ridiculousness of it all but it\\'s nothing great & I doubt I would ever want to see it again.\",neg\\r\\n\"Pretty twisted Horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes, however it\\'s just too dull for it\\'s own good. All the characters are OK, and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull, however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It\\'s well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn\\'t keep up the pace, plus I found the ending to be disappointing. Linnea Quigley has no more then a very small role in this so, I was also disappointed about that, and Stephen Knight does a good job as the lead, as he was pretty twisted, plus I got this in a DVD Horror set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a bunch of other Horror films. There is lots of blood,however it\\'s not all that gory, and for it\\'s low budget it was pretty well done, however as I said it just couldn\\'t sustain it\\'s interest. This is a pretty twisted Horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy blood transfusion scenes, however it\\'s just too dull for it\\'s own good, I would pass,but I guess it\\'s worth a watch if you have nothing better to do. The Direction is OK. Elly Kenner&Norman Thaddeus Vane do an OK job here with decent camera work, and doing a good job on it\\'s low budget, however the pace is too inconsistent for my liking. The Acting is actually alright. Stephen Knight is great as the lead, he was creepy, twisted, sick, and gave a very creepy performance, the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is OK I guess sin his short time. Rest of the cast are OK as well. Overall I would pass, but I guess it\\'s worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do. *1/2 out of 5\",neg\\r\\n\"Final Draft - A screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks himself into his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. Not a terrible premise, but the execution is awful. This feels like a first year direction and writing job, and probably is. The director jump cuts the hell out of everything. It\\'s meant to be disorienting. What it IS is annoying. So much so that small chunks of film are incoherent. The writing is predictable, and doesn\\'t use follow through on most of the ideas it offers (bag of oranges). It\\'s like they ran out of time and slap-dashed it together for the Toronto Film Festival.This film is not jaw-droppingly \"\"oh my god it\\'s so bad it\\'s good\"\" bad. It\\'s boring bad, and irritates you for a long time afterward. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor, and keeps the ship barely above water. But he\\'s too normal for the kind of psychosis the film tries to offer. He is merely a withdrawn guy who one day sees people and hallucinates things, then decides to act mildly deranged. Cause follows effect. Maybe there\\'s something in the water. Now Darryn Lucio, who plays his \"\"friend\"\", is a terrible actor. He shares the likeness of Chris O\\'Donald and is even more annoying, a superhuman achievement.The atmosphere the film provides is good (dull gray and somber), but as it\\'s the only thing the film achieves it means nothing. This film wants to be Jacob\\'s Ladder or The Machinist. It isn\\'t even Secret Window. It\\'s the preppy girl in class deciding to turn goth.Not irksomely terrible, but the sheer stupidity of it will ebb at you. I\\'ve already put more thought into this critique than the filmmakers did for this.D\",neg\\r\\nThere was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clich\\xc3\\xa9s but nothing about it is remotely funny. Most of the movies they parody doesn\\'t even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. Non The main actor was well cast in it but that\\'s really the only good thing about this film. Also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage. Thank goodness I only spent $4 on it as this is not something worth spending money on. ONly watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes.,neg\\r\\n\"SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it\\'s self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie. What makes this movie special you say? Throughout the movie you see blinken and acuhu walk beside each other becoming great friends as Robin Hood\\'s sidekicks. But, it Blinken is never told or fails to grasp that he is black, until the crowd says \"\" a black sheriff\"\", Blinken replays \"\"He\\'s black\"\". That is a timeless scene. Simple one of the most enteraining movies of our time.\",pos\\r\\n\"Boasting some pretty good Rick Baker-esque special effects and Deran Serafian in a small role, this pretty lame Italian movie deserves some recognition. Cerchi gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava, and Enzo G. Castellari) have moved on to lower-key TV movies. As for plankton, it\\'s half Piranha - half The Thing, with people turninging into monsters, raping women, and causing general mayhem. The ultra-grimy, sleazy, and over-sexed feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy. Only available in Italian language work-prints floating around.\",neg\\r\\n\"No movie could ever do justice to Faulkner\\'s command of the English language. but they did a pretty good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly the way I pictured him in the book, as is Chick. What the movie couldn\\'t really go into was how Beauchamp wasn\\'t liked by the Negro people either, because he was equally as stubborn. Not that it is a bad thing, but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world (yet, I got the feeling it was white society\\'s racism that started it and it spilled over into Negro society, until that became his attitude toward everyone).the best part of the movie is that you get to see Yoknapatawpha county (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing). It doesn\\'t look that much different today. Because of this alone, the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in Faulkner\\'s backyard. A true must see for Faulkner fans.\",pos\\r\\n\"There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about \"\"cold spots\"\" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. I\\'e seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all (\"\"it\\'s getting cold!\"\") Basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary. It\\'s obviously not real, but the house does contain some cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you won\\'t be able to predict most of the plot!). Not much happens in this film. We have the time-honored horror cliche of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning, as a \"\"practice\"\" scare to warm up the audience. The people wander around with flashlights, occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace- that they mean no harm to the spirits (or cold spots) within. Now and then a door will swing shut and startle somebody. Of course , the ouija board makes an appearance. They chat with a ghost named \"\"Charles\"\". A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it. More cold spots. Another door swings shut and some guy goes off about the scuff sound of the door. Scuff, scuff, he says. Oh my god, somebody says. \"\"Surround yourself with white light.\"\" I admit there is a good scene in the attic (where a chair is knocked over by a ghost) that really caught me off guard. But aside from some funny bad dialogue, the chair scene (the actual split-second when it is knocked over, nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. However there are still some cold spots in here. Eventually, the movie ends. Nobody dies. No more details necessary. I wasn\\'t a big fan of Blair Witch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to the St. Francisville Experiment. You may find yourself not debating whether or not this is a real documentary, but whether or not it was intended to be funny. I still don\\'t know. But whatever it was intended to be, it failed.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie was fabulous. It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film. The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that. I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part). Overall this is an excellent movie, an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans. \",pos\\r\\n\"The movie starts in spring 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) while on break. Within the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he has to go off to war and she has to go to college. They do but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 9/11 happens. He wants to reenlist--she wants him to stay home. What will they do? Hysterically bad romantic drama. The leads ARE attractive--Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he\\'s introduced walking shirtless out of the water after surfing)...but he can\\'t act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries...but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it me and a friend of mine were fighting hard NOT to laugh out loud at some of the \"\"romantic\"\" dialogue at the beginning. It was just HORRIBLE. For the first hour or so I was either bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous \"\"romance\"\". Then, after that first hour, tragedy kicks in and, I must admit, had me in tears. However the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that you\\'re crying with death, funerals and meetings with people breaking down in tears. How can you NOT cry? This would have worked if the acting were better. Tatum\\'s face never changes expression--not ONCE! He always had a blank look on his face. Seyfried was a LITTLE better but not much. To make it worse Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on screen at all! They barely looked like they liked each other let alone love each other. There was some beautiful photography of the Carolinas but this is a boring and stupid romantic \"\"drama\"\". A 1 all the way...and I usually love silly romantic dramas like this!\",neg\\r\\n\"At times I really wonder\\xc2\\x85 when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have. I\\'ve just seen it... and liked it. Not in the way, that it made me happy, but in the way of having seen a good film!The film needs some patience, yes. And yes, the main character is REALLY annoying, but that I\\'m sure is by intention.Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home. Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music. This movie definitely doesn\\'t fit as background noise.And no. Good directing doesn\\'t mean having five laughs or explosions a second. Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together. And while that doesn\\'t work out perfectly, at least I think it works quite good.I liked the photography and sets, even if they brink on the surreal at times. The opening scene is really special.I also liked the acting \\xc2\\x96 Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be, he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot, a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself.People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff: No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained, there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone.And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war, most likely Bosnia (which was still going on, when the film was produced). At least that\\'s what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover, which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.\",pos\\r\\n\"Halloween:The Curse Of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel out of all of the Halloween flicks. Jamie, serial killer Michael Myers\\' niece, bears a baby who is then taken by the Man In Black from the conclusion of Halloween 5. A kind nurse helps Jamie escapes but Myers quickly tracks her down and kills her. Jamie\\'s baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of the kids Jamie Lee babysat in the original film, and Myers arrives in Haddonfield and begins to kill off the Strode clan living in his old house. The film concludes with scenes revealing clues to Michael\\'s evil, the identity of the Man In Black, and a close to the whole Dr. Loomis/Michael Myers storyline. I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece.Halloween:The Curse Of Michael Myers is Rated R for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language, and brief nudity.\",pos\\r\\n\"The German regional-broadcast-station WDR has shown both \"\"The General\"\" and ODC. On Saturday I\\'ve seen \"\"The General\"\" and I thought, it wasn\\'t very bad, but not very good too. But yesterday I\\'ve seen ODC and I switched it off after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor the movie was totally confusing and seems restless. \"\"The General\"\" told the story straight and ordered, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a reference on the Guy Ritchie Movies \"\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\"\" and \"\"Snatch\"\", but doesn\\'t have the Coolness of these movies.So, in the end I would rate it 3 of 10!\",neg\\r\\n\"The movie is a very good movie.one of the best from Yash raj films.The direction is incredible.The screenplay is brilliant.The story is excellent.It tells about Rahul who is obssed of Kiran his college friend.He is a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone(anyway she died 15 years back) etc.Kiran is engaged to Sunil.Rahul does everything so he can get her.He even trys to kill Sunil but he survives it.He even goes to the place where they are going to their honeymoon.The movie is every nes delight.Shahrukh is superb,Juhi is fairly good,Sunny is average,Anupham is okay and so is Tanvi,Dalip did good.The movie belongs to Srk.The dialogues are brilliant(Shahrukh ones and a lot if not the overacting and comedy).\"\"Jaadu Teri Nazar\"\" and \"\"Tu Mere Samne\"\" are absolutely melodious tracks.\",pos\\r\\n\"My original comment on this particular title was deleted, by a IMDb user or the staff, only because I just happen to dislike this film to the point I had to sincerely write what I felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film. where\\'s my freedom of word?Obviously this movie was made by students, \\'cos so lame and amateurish it felt. Of course even they have to start from somewhere? The script was incoherent mess and so was the acting. With low budget and b- class actors, what can you expect? There\\'s some CGI in places, so poor, it looks like done with an old PC. Some may say, this is sort of an \"\"Alien\"\" clone, only this time it\\'s Dracula (in a vintage costume) who\\'s sucking the other cast dry, one by one. The sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large space craft. It would be fun to know what the stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) thought about the film after it was released... Coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever!It was a total waste of my time and money, don\\'t know why I even bothered to rent this flick. Honestly, I just hate this film. With Uwe Boll\\'s House Of The Dead, Dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever. (Well, I\\'ve seen even worse than these two)Avoid! Any other film will do better.\",neg\\r\\nThis film just won the best film award at the Cleveland International Film Festival. It\\'s American title apparently is Autumn Spring. The acting is superb. The story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and spikes it up a little bit. Abetted by his best friend (and partner in not-so-serious crime) he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold. His longsuffering wife has come to her wits end and makes a life-changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch. The resolution of the story is beautiful.,pos\\r\\n\"Even die hard John Wayne fans will have to concede that this film is a mess. Wayne\\'s character, John Tobin is after the gang that killed his parents, led by half Apache, half white renegade Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), posing as a Mexican. There are almost too many silly plot points to count, but those that stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) cuffing a captured Zanti around his boot, so all Zanti has to do to get free is remove his boot! Tobin\\'s friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a thrown knife in the back, and comes back good as new for the rest of the story. In a chase scene, Tobin rides a makeshift log flume through a drainage trough surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and missing his mark, chases (actually walks after) Zanti on foot through the desert. Zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but OOPS!, he didn\\'t see the sign above the waterhole that states \"\"Don\\'t Drink Poison\"\". As Zanti collapses dead, Tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang, and captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage into Dusty\\'s cabin - how convenient.In the closing scene, the new Sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), Dusty\\'s daughter Ruby, who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of Zanti\\'s gang. Apparently, the studio was intent on Wayne\\'s getting the girl in virtually every film they made with him, as this type of ending is completely predictable for almost all of Lone Star\\'s films.\",neg\\r\\n\"I actually saw this movie at a cinema. At the time, I was working shifts and went there during a matin\\xc3\\xa9e on a hot summer day when I couldn\\'t sleep. The cinema was air-conditioned.It was an early multi-screen complex and I somehow got into the wrong venue. I had intended to doze through something else. But as things transpired, there would be no sleeping. Shortly after the wrong movie began, I was additionally disconcerted by a group of female cleaners who came in and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there, and it is a measure of the movie\\'s appeal that they habitually expected the place to be empty and asked me if I minded their presence. I didn\\'t.Within about half an hour, the cleaners\\' conversation proved to be more interesting than the entertainment I had paid for.This movie oozed out of the screen with the cheesiness of very stale mayonnaise. The kind that has little dark, hairy, tufts growing on the surface. I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning. The cleaners provided an anticipatory cue by putting their fingers in their ears.It was about some city bird going to live in the sticks amongst a load a backwood folk, putting them straight but at the same time being taught a moral lesson or two herself. Like you do. A sort of \\'journey of discovery\\'. There was a sententious smugness about the whole production. In particular, the leading actress had an irritating habit of staring at every hick with a kind of intense beatific compassion, as if she herself were the patron-saint of thickies.And I believe at some stage she wrote a book.Long before the end, I had become fascinated by one of the cleaner\\'s hushed and breathy tails of sexual impropriety.One suspects that there are some to whom sitting quietly for a couple of hours and not having to think, constitutes a meditation. The best that I can say is that I would not want to share their salad.I have never seen this movie advertised as showing on television, which surprises me. It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.If you ever work shifts, be sure to get into the right theatre. Or hope for some cleaning ladies.\",neg\\r\\n\"Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, nor cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots! What is this movie?! First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything. Not worth your while, just leave it on the shelf (or garbage can) you found it on. On second note, This film was shot in Cailifornia, not Loch Ness, a major diss to Nessie fans.\",neg\\r\\n\"The producer, Matt Mochary, stumbled upon the film\\'s subject, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement), when on a Hewlett Foundation trip to Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by Sa\\'s story that he called his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbalist, who quit his job and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary on Sa, Rio\\'s favelas, and the culture of violence.The first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in Rio\\'s favelas (shantytowns where the poor live) via footage of police raids and assaults on the residents. The footage is graphic and shocking.Rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic Anderson Sa, who overcame a possible career in drug dealing to start the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture, Reggae, ska, and other elements into a fast-paced, percussion heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world. You can\\'t help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the local children get involved in Sa\\'s school, which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sa\\'s meteoric rise and his positivity changes many of the children\\'s lives to seek a life beyond drug running. SPOILER: Just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming, an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed. The film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end.This film is a response to \"\"City of God,\"\" and a worthy one at that. The bleak situation portrayed in that movie is countered by a real example of how favela dwellers can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to constructive ends. You can\\'t help not liking and rooting for Anderson Sa to succeed.This film is terrifically shot, fast-paced, and is quite absorbing. Judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last night\\'s SilverDocs screening, the film should get domestic distribution in the US and the thumping soundtrack should be released as well. Keep an eye for this superlative documentary--it is excellent!\",pos\\r\\n\"The problem with TV today is that people have been spoiled by \"\"lite\"\" TV viewing. This type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or \"\"easy listening\"\" jazz. The typical viewers idea of \"\"continuity\"\" is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go. Show them a program like surface, Firefly, Dr. Who, or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and...well, they\\'ll just flip back to Survivor.95% of the sheep watching TV don\\'t want to rack their brains. They want excuses to not think. They want to make sure the \"\"boob tube\"\" lives up to its name...and they don\\'t want shows that try and go any other route. Because of this, Surface and many other high-quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe.TV viewers don\\'t want stories, or morals, or philosophy, or anything over a third grade vocabulary level. They want people eating earthworms, or over-dramatized \"\"real life\"\" series (no such thing! You cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe) or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends.Today\\'s television is nothing but a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore. Surface was one of those diamonds.\",pos\\r\\n\"Logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film Love Love is and am totally confused. Seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up. \"\"Plastic demon baby\"\" what? This wasn\\'t Love Life. A little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great, funny and original film. Especially liked the ending that didn\\'t fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it. Nine out of ten.\",pos\\r\\n\"Oppenheimer\\' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest. Well written, well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative, and very entertaining. The set designs and costumes capture the feel of the US during World War 2, and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at Los Alamos and caught up in the excitement of the Manhattan Project. The only downside is that this is a British production, and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing American accent. (The skill of current day Australian & Irish actors taking on non-native dialects is amazing.) The storyline is fully consistent with Richard Rhodes\\' definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb. Sadly, the mini-series was shown only a couple of times on PBS at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion.\\'Oppenheimer\\' compares favorably to the more recent \\'Fat Man & Little Boy\\' feature film with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely General would be thoroughly flattered) and Dwight Schultz (alumnus of TV\\'s \\'A-Team\\') as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, \\'Oppenheimer\\' is around 4x as long as the Newman feature, but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage.\",pos\\r\\n\"Watch it with an open mind, it is very different, nothing\\'s cutesy about this. Very well done realistic tale of Tarzan. The animatronics chimpazees are well done for \\'84, Christopher Lambert was brilliant imitating chimpazee language and behavior. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall.\",pos\\r\\n\"Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb\\'s homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (and unjustly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But, even in its treatment of this Swoon over does it by far. Worse, it twists, combines, and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it. While it is an interestingly made film, Swoon stinks.1 out of 10 - awful.\",neg\\r\\n\"One of the movies i just DIDN\\'T want to see. I got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.Also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it\\'s filmed from a book of Giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.\",neg\\r\\n\"New Orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in thisdebacle of a film. Quaid\\'s attempt at speaking with a cajunaccent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks that way in NewOrleans) is terrible. Plot = elementary and mindless. Thispicture refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves agradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film. There\\'s none of that here. \"\"BigEasy\"\" tries to get by on trite New Orleans stereotypes. Don\\'t be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the townthat Quaid & Barkin bumble their way through.\",neg\\r\\n\"I really wanted to like this film, especially after all the buzz I\\'d heard revolving around it. But, sadly, it just didn\\'t work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation did--If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this film is contrived. I wasn\\'t impressed with the \\'write it all down\\' confessional being the way the protagonist deals with the accident--So what are we supposed to believe? He grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences, thus was vindicated for that horrific incident?What is, I suspect, supposed to be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is directionless and faced with an impossible moral quandary, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection to anyone around him, and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit that merely coasts through life as he weaves his way along on his skateboard. I don\\'t feel for him at all, and honestly I wish he\\'d been caught. The entire film centres not necessarily on his feelings of guilt, but on how he is going to avoid punishment and/or accountability for a bad decision. He not only gets away with it, he finds a way to subtly rationalise it. Quite a frightening, negative message, the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so disconnected from right and twrong that they simply make up the rules as they go along, serving themselves for good or ill. I find it an insulting treatsie on today\\'s youth, and the pretentious arrogance of the film-maker drips thick with every plodding, overthought step and shifting eye.(He did murder the guard, but if you blink your eyes you miss it. Whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to say--it could be he was so mortified he lashed out with his skateboard. When he runs to the security guard\\'s car, one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood. )\",neg\\r\\n\"Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I\\'m not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars...they had a tough job because they didn\\'t really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly. The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going. When Curley started crying I lost it...Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better. Maybe it\\'s fitting though...the Stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.\",neg\\r\\n\"Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper as \"\"Cleent\"\" so perfectly cast as a laconic Texan who knows this gal is up to no good. When the two lock eyes at the French Market, we know this match will be full of sparks. When they stroll in her garden in her restored French Quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics.The costumes are lovely; the set decoration makes you wish the \"\"Quarter\"\" was just that way. And that Saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping.From Edna Ferbers novel, the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry.In the Saratoga scenes, Florence Bates as a grand dame steals every scene.But it is the scene of Cleo taking on the little lawyer her New Orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a Magic Movie Moment. After Cleo has bested him in the negotiations, he looks at her with longing and says \"\"may I say - you are very-beautiful\"\". And Cleo with a happy, wicked smile says \"\"yes, isn\\'t it lucky.\"\" You want to shout \"\"YES\"\"!!!One of my all time favorite romantic films.\",pos\\r\\n\"On a scale of 1-10 \"\"Suicidal Sweetheart\"\" got an 11 from me and from everyone else at this showing. The picture was incredibly funny. I told my wife \"\"It\\'s obvious that this man walks on water but across a bed of fire, that\\'s a bit much.\"\" This is one of the very best blends of comedy, satire and uses of innuendo I have seen since Mel Brooks\\' \"\"Young Frankenstein\"\". I can\\'t believe this picture was not picked up by a major studio.This \"\"Film Festival\"\" audience was sophisticated and was able to pick up on every comic innuendo either visual, spoken or implied. The characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great casting was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems that are dealt with regardless of the odds of success. It keeps you smiling while being serious and laughing with all the indirect humor brilliantly built into this production.To sum it up, this is a \"\"must see\"\" picture.\",pos\\r\\n\"A satire about greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. Jim Carrey\\'s reign was certainly short lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. He produced this, this \"\"masterpiece\"\" as well, so he can\\'t blame anyone here. \"\"The number one comedy in America\"\" shout the desperate TV adds. Of course, Jim Carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over. If I sound angry is because I am. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, plus, between tickets, parking, flat Cokes etc, almost 45 bucks on this thing, starring and produced by Mr Carry. Not anymore, do you hear? Not anymore.\",neg\\r\\n\"During my struggle to stay awake during this borefest, I fought through my near-dosing off to discover some silly plot regarding fraternity schmucks, quite incredibly obnoxiously annoying, running into trouble with a psychotic , radioactively damaged half-human/half cyborg named Splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of their prestigious, politically vocal leader(..for whom Splatter killed himself, setting them up to take the blame so he could become the leader). These face-painted freaks form a group who express their feelings anarchically, though non-violently, living on dilapidated streets abandoned by the \"\"civilized world\"\" voicing their concerns regarding nuclear disarmament. Anyways, most of the film has these five frat goons running throughout darkened streets with graffiti walls, as Splatter and his punks pursue them. Thankfully for these guys, they find a punk chic to assist them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain with which they\\'re unfamiliarized. This territory the frat guys are immersed is a veritable labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of an exit out most difficult particularly when crazies and Splatter\\'s bunch occupy nearly every turn.Yeah, I was duped like others thanks to the HR Giger poster which is most excellent. If only he had been the designer of this dreck..this is not the case and we, the viewer, are left a film modeled after, of all movies it seems, Walter Hill\\'s THE WARRIORS, except this film doesn\\'t have the style or grit that film has. The film has a plethora of unfunny bits and lame confrontations between the frats and the punks with hand to hand combats often laughable. The setting is rather interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but it\\'s not the environment that\\'s the problem..it\\'s the plot and characters within the environment that grow tiresome. The saddlebags under my eyes weighed heavier every minute this movie continued. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW stars Edwin Neal(..quite a funny voice-man, who has an entertaining interview on the DVD I rented for this flaming turd of a film)and Marilyn Burns have \"\"key\"\" roles as opposing members of their faction against the government resulting in the final conclusion within a building complex at the end. Neal\\'s character Splatter uses these metal spikes which emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.\",neg\\r\\n\"Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. She truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in \"\"Camille\"\" (1936) and her best remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in \"\"Gone With the Wind\"\".Irene Dunne was the \"\"official\"\" star of the film but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite.David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Centre. Their first stop in America is a visit to David\\'s mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is an under-statement. From her first entrance - in a frantic burst of effort to greet her \"\"big boy\"\" - all attention is on her. Even sitting around the tea table, when she forgets Hester\\'s existence, even forgetting how she takes her tea, you know something is not quite right.(Hester has been living there for a while.)Frances Dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable Hester. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how under-rated as an actress she was.All the young cast are excellent. Eric Linden is superb as Robert, the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother\\'s spell. Joel McCrea, at one point says \"\"painting roses on bathtubs - that\\'s more your style\"\". There is a very subtle suggestion in the film of Robert\\'s sexuality.Irene Dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried.\",pos\\r\\n\"Don\\'t worry - no spoilers here, just saying there is a very predictable plot. A couple decide to live in his father\\'s love nest so they can write a book/article/newsletter on his fling with a famous tragic Hollywood starlet. This whole production ran kind of like a high school troupe doing an episode of \"\"Murder She Wrote\"\". The only acting I was sold on was the old fogy\\'s they interviewed for sources in the story. Apparently the directors thought the movie was getting too long, so towards the end they stopped pointing their camera to a kind of creepy image of the starlet and brought in plot enhancers to wrap this thing up. Don\\'t waste your time - even the tried and true horror/intrigue classics fail in this movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"One Dark Night has a typical teen horror film set-up with a quite a unique twist. The ultra-brooding musical score and Gothic/claustrophobic atmosphere adds greatly to this small film that delivers. Meg Tilly is excellent as \"\"Julie,\"\" and leads us through the maze of the mausoleum, giving a sense of foreboding and loneliness. The other teens are equally effective in their roles as is Melissa Newman, the ultimate heroine of the film. The special effects are excellent, though dated. This film is highly overlooked, but that may be good so that it was never ruined by endless sequels. There is a great, dark magic flowing through this film; once tapped into, you really get it and you\\'re in for some fun. The double-disc DVD is available, though the original negative could not be found to restore the film. Maybe someday it will be located. I guess in some ways the carbon speckles in parts do help the film by giving it an old school respectability and making it more unexpected at the end when suddenly there are plenty of effects.The second disc has a rough cut/alternate version with a temp score version of the film that gives more explanation of the demise of two of the girls, very Poe-ish(\"\"The Cask of Amontillado\"\" comes to mind in a new way!) Also, great ending tension going in on the dark crypt opening. Not sure it had the punch for main stream audiences, but certainly worked for me and extremely creepy.. . also, there is a making of documentary that is interesting because it gives info on what was going on at the time with the actors, crew, director and writer; candid material, then current logos, discussions of shots and scenes, rehearsals. Very unique that this stuff exists for a small film back then.\",pos\\r\\n\"Problems: 1) Although billed as \"\"a loving tribute to Poverty Row,\"\" a lot of the old footage is not even from Poverty Row films-- much of it is from RKO\\'s \"\"The Most Dangerous Game,\"\" (1932), with some from the silent (!?) version of \"\"The Lost World\"\" (1926)! 2) Much of the old footage is just used as filler (the old shipboard footage) or as silent shots (for example, of Bela walking, looking or staring) often repeated; 3) Where is the pantheon of Poverty Row Master Thespians (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) emoting their lines as punch lines to the \\'new\\' characters jokes (as in Woody Allen\\'s \"\"What\\'s Up Tiger Lily?\"\" or Steve Martin\\'s \"\"Dead Men Don\\'t Wear Plaid\"\")? Even Mike Nelson\\'s feeble commentary on the colorized \"\"Reefer Madness\"\" is funnier than this. High Point: The long but extremely enlightening lecture by Gregory Mank which makes you give new respect to and admiration for Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco. That\\'s worth the price of the DVD alone!\",neg\\r\\n\"\"\"The Phenix City Story\"\" is a brutal, hard-hitting docudrama about what was once dubbed the \"\"wickedest town in America.\"\" The film documents the events that led up to the murder by the Phenix City crime syndicate of Albert Patterson, an Alabama attorney who made a bid for the state attorney general\\'s office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption plaguing his hometown. His son, John Patterson, picked up his father\\'s mantle after his death and won the post, making clean up of Phenix City a primary item on his agenda.Director Phil Karlson created a film that has the ability to shock even today. The grimness is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch. We see the crime syndicate beat and kill in order to get what they want -- the beatings and killings include women and children, and one scene in particular, revolving around the death of a little black girl, is especially disturbing. It\\'s not exactly an enjoyable film, because there\\'s very little payoff at the end to reward the viewer for sitting through the infuriating events leading up to it, but it\\'s a well made film, full of an intense and angry energy.A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of Phenix City, some of who are then portrayed by actors in the fictional portion of the film. It lends the film a quality of urgency that carries over into the narrative, so that we feel like we\\'re watching a documentary the entire time, a feeling that\\'s helped by Karlson\\'s choice to film on actual locations.I\\'m glad I saw this movie, but it\\'s one of those films that fills you with a sense of righteous indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can\\'t do anything about it.Grade: A\",pos\\r\\nI didn\\'t know anything about this DVD when I hired it. Had a quick look here at the comments but decided to keep an open mind. Obviously an independent film and low budget but that didn\\'t worry me. I will watch anything with Derick Jacobi and as always he played his part well. What a pity no one else did. I had watched \\'Atonement\\' a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave and she was sublime. In this she seemed to just turn up to read the lines. In my opinion the main mistake was in casting Vinnie Jones. To be honest I saw his picture on the DVD cover but didn\\'t notice that he got top billing. A sticker was strategically placed over his name! It was watchable and I quite liked the Dickens story alongside present day. Maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this might have worked better. Still it was weak.,neg\\r\\n\"This documentary traces the origins and life of the Zephyr skateboard team, using original film shot in the 1970s (mostly by Craig Stecyk) combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today.The first part of the film documents how the \"\"Dogtown\"\" section of Venice, CA came to be, starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a Venice, Italy-like European city. By the 1970\\'s, the one remaining local attraction, the Pacific Ocean Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards. The poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. Because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. I found that the film covered much more about surfing than I expected, which seemed like a bonus since I really didn\\'t know much about surfing or skateboarding before I watched the film. The soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. I also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience. The parts that didn\\'t work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team\\'s somewhat overinflated sense of self-importance (although this is probably just left-over street attitude from where they grew up). This is not to say that they didn\\'t have significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. One note: My wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as \"\"SpastiCam\"\" (wiggling camera movements). This film is often guilty, so if you are so afflicted, be warned. I would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and/or surfing in their history.Seen on 5/11/2002.\",pos\\r\\n\"GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit-com MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE . Though I haven\\'t seen the series since it was last broadcast I do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish Fourmile family , a sort of LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR without the cynical racist gags .Having seen this \"\" big screen version of the show \"\" I find myself asking what it\\'s a big screen version of ? Certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name . For some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having George and Mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something George has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like: \"\" Did he give it to you \"\" \"\" No that\\'s the first time a man has resisted my charms \"\" \"\" I meant the envelope \"\" You do get the impression that screenwriter Dick Sharples ( Who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com ) has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the CARRY ON series of films . In many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter LOST IN SPACE movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it\",neg\\r\\n\"So I caught this one afternoon as \"\"What Lies Above\"\" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn\\'t help her when her fianc\\xc3\\xa9 Brian gets hurt on a climb. When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won\\'t go near Snowman\\'s Pass. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fianc\\xc3\\xa9 with a new satellite program. She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt\\'s two assistants: His \"\"bodyguard\"\" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler. From the start, you know that there\\'s some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren\\'t good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition. The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman\\'s Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana\\'s dream sequence halfway through the movie. But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball. The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that\\'s why I can\\'t for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie. This was the major plot. This was how the movie STARTED! How do you NOT wrap that up?I wouldn\\'t tell too many people to bother with this one...\",neg\\r\\n\"I laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether. I adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux. Andersson gives us something else here. Shows us something I had not seen since his last film. He is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. It is powerful stuff. It is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. Andersson\\'s attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe most scenes, if not all, are sets built from scratch according to his designs. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. For me it took me to a place and I came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful, starched and pained, barren and splendid. At once alien and familiar. This film is brilliant and life affirming. I know because I came out smiling feeling wonderful. It has taken him seven years to make this. If he only made this one film he would still be up there with the greats.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something, they can be better than the pros. The main character, Doug, showed off his skills in flying a Cessna aircraft, which somehow equated to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people. We all would like to have a few million dollars to play with... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this movie decided to make Iron Eagle... not once... not twice... not even three times; yes, four times. The thing to look most forward to are the multitude \\'hollywood endings\\' in this movie. Just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence, there\\'s another cheesy end sequence. Then another. Definitely a movie one must watch to believe... and maybe own just to remind oneself of how awesome the 80s must have been.\",neg\\r\\n\"This film tries very hard to be an \"\"action\"\" film, but it fails miserably.Steve Guttenberg plays the head of an elite counter-terrorist team that fails (?) in attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent.The story...the acting...the special effects...ALL FALL FLAT!!!Definitely A MUST AVOID!!!!\",neg\\r\\n\"*Criticism does mention spoilers*I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie I have no problem slandering. This movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were, despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie\\'s character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse\\' hands). The movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie\\'s character and Denzel Washington\\'s. Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off. Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Rear Window). The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think the murderer\\'s intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial \\'chess game\\' and gets with his pet project, Angelina.If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am), you will not appreciate this film. If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible \\'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you\\'d be bored.\",neg\\r\\n\"Early Coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see (a pity). There\\'s some wonderful things going on in this one - Shirley Knight\\'s best performance (an underrated actress), a road trip in the late 1960\\'s, James Caan very restrained and moving, Robert Duvall in a part he was born to play (edgy, lonely, motorcycle cop), and a touching script with F. Coppola behind the wheel.If this had been made five years LATER by some nobody, it would have been a smash (so much for timing). Anyway, I recommend this to all people who don\\'t need outer-space explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold. Give this one a chance if you can find it!\",pos\\r\\n\"I haven\\'t seen \"\"Hardware Wars\"\" in years, but I remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience, and it was over far too soon. Every aspect of this movie was hilarious, and it was even better than \"\"Star Wars.\"\" I laughed. I cried. After watching it, I asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just so I could kiss it goodbye (I\\'m kidding about the last one). I love it when Ham Salad\\'s sidekick/co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid\\'s cinnamon hair buns, and the Darph Nader character is just hilarious! This film would be great to watch back-to-back with \"\"Thumb Wars,\"\" and I sincerely wish there could have been a \"\"Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Umpire Strikes Out.\"\" (Was there?)\",pos\\r\\n\"Guy Pearce almost looks like Flynn, and this resemblance is the only one this film can claim. Nowhere in Flynn\\'s autobiography is the Klaus Reicher character mention, the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction, and the movie\\'s claims that Flynn treated native labor badly are groundless. Director Frank Howson hasn\\'t made any memorable films, and I find it lame for him to groundlessly slander Flynn to further his unremarkable career.\",neg\\r\\n\"I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see Superman Returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie playing was \"\"See No Evil\"\", there was no poster up for it, and just a short description of the movie on the schedule...but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out...As soon as I saw it was produced by WWE I just knew it was gonna be awful. The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and it was the first movie that I honestly considered walking out on, and I\\'ve seen \"\"The Ringer\"\"...okay, I would have walked out of that one, but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just stupid.\",neg\\r\\n\"A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane\\'s (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There\\'re some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero\\'s character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn\\'t bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.\",pos\\r\\n\"Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education, fail & they will never become qualified Doctors. A bright, young, attractive & intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) & is a convicted killer, he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) & her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first Don won\\'t even look at Eve much less talk to her, but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out. Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve, he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn, as Don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred. Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient...?Written & directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn. Now, we all like a good twist ending, the sort of ending which catches us unawares, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn\\'t that obvious. Then, of course, there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take, oh I don\\'t know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an awful ending to a film, never. Breaking Dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve, it\\'s not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest, it\\'s not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it\\'s not that bad a film until the twist ending, I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail, all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as I\\'m concerned it doesn\\'t make a bit of sense & never will. Breaking Dawn is crap & it\\'s a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history, it\\'s as simple & straight forward as that.Director Robinson doesn\\'t half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but I\\'d imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot. He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it\\'s all for nought at the end of the day.Technically Breaking Dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout. The acting is pretty good, Overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance. Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me...Breaking Dawn is rubbish, I hated it all because of the final few minutes. Don\\'t get me wrong it wasn\\'t exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid as far as I\\'m concerned although it seems to have it\\'s fair share of positive comments on the IMDb...\",neg\\r\\n\"After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine.The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent flick (not Van Damme\\'s best, but definitely not his worst.) There is some bad acting from VD\\'s supporting cast, but it makes sense.The storyline and plot has all been done before, so it\\'s nothing new. I mean this is Van Damme. We don\\'t really expect much of an amazing plot do we? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway: the fighting.Without giving anything away, I thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done, way better than a few of VD\\'s recent movies such as Second in Command, in which the entire end fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you\\'ve seen Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it. A few of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VD\\'s older stuff which is what we all want to see. The fights were good, and i said \"\"hah, awesome\"\" out loud a few times. But I was hoping for just a bit more considering how good I thought Undisputed 2 was.Something I found intriguing was VD\\'s daughter in the film, I thought \"\"wow she\\'s kinda hot\"\" come to find out, its Bianca Van Varenberg, JC\\'s real life daughter. I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat.All in all, this movie is not half bad. Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie. Next time though, add more hand to hand combat! I think He still has what it takes to do another big budget movie...his acting has improved since he\\'s been doing DTV\\'s and he really is in great shape at 47. I don\\'t know about you but I\\'m one of the ones who thinks that most of his DTV\\'s are actually good with the exception of Derailed. All he needs to do is get back into \"\"bloodsport\"\" shape, and make a martial arts movie...and I think people would respond well even though he\\'s not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth the rental. =)\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a title in search of a movie. It\\'s a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned. When this film was made there were still two things that CGI did not do at all well: people, and fur. Furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer. This is the only example I can think of where effects for a well-funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie. For the record, the design of the werewolves doesn\\'t help a bit. The film-makers apparently couldn\\'t decide between quadruped and biped, tried to do both, and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way. The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the crass part. This is a movie which exists PURELY to cash in on its forebear. I am not a fan of Landis\\' original film but boy, does it look good in light of this. If you thought some of Landis\\' humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here. The bubble gum scene, the corpse humor, the dog that...you know, you\\'ll just have to watch that bit yourselves. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting the \"\"ugly American\\' and bungee jump off the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night. This leads to him rescuing a young woman (Delpy - Julie it\\'s not worth this just to become a star in America. Ask Rutger Hauer) from jumping to her death. She turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are plotting to...I\\'m not sure, something bad. Ghastly French stereotypes, gaping plot-holes, a muddled ending. No matter, the studio cared only that the title would likely fool millions of \"\"American Werewolf in London\"\" fans into handing over their cash. For the most part, happy to say, they were wrong.\",neg\\r\\n\"I went it to see this film with caution. A suicidal \"\"comedy\"\" didn\\'t seem consistent. Having a brother who is has attempted suicide and seeing the devastation that has caused our whole family, I know first hand how crushing it can be to deal with this issue. I must say - This film deals with it in a way that allows the viewer \"\"inside\"\" someone who is suffering and simply doesn\\'t know why, or how to stop it. While the film is not perfect, it respects the subject matter and more importantly makes it accessible for the masses. I know for our family, humor has helped us through a lot of the pain. And, Max and Grace is just what it portends to be - a suicidal COMEDY. It\\'s funny - And, I also felt that characters were real and vibrant. It\\'s also extremely intelligent, yet simple. It cuts to the chase and I appreciate that! I give it a 9 and will recommend it.\",pos\\r\\n\"TART is the worst movie I\\'ve seen this year, and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don\\'t know if that\\'s a fair comparison seeing that TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction.*** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don\\'t think there\\'s anything to spoil)TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids. Most of them reside in super-sized apartments along New York\\'s hyper-expensive Park Avenue, thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents. The film showcases the aimless life of one of the students (Cat) as she discards her only true friend (as frivolous a person as she was) in the pursuit of the \"\"good life\"\" with the in-crowd. That, of course, leads to sex, drugs, and music that is substantially worse than rock & roll. Everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are. Cat\\'s first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose. No heavy-handed messages there, he said sarcastically.That\\'s mainly what the \"\"seen it before 100 times\"\" plot entails. Other minor, and even less interesting, plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others, a wild child who lives life on the edge (and finally falls off of it one night in the EAST Hamptons), an anti-Semitic British chick who ends her close friendship with Cat the moment she finds out Cat has a Jewish father, and Cat\\'s strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get Cat to appreciate the privileged life she has. The thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife. The \"\"wild child\"\" is played as a toned down version of one of the Hilton sisters. The British girl disappears from the film after the break-up. The mother/daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film\\'s final schmaltzy scene, where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts. *yawn**** END SPOILERS ***About the cast and crew.... Dominique Swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997\\'s highly watchable LOLITA and FACE/OFF. Her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few \"\"ones-to-watch\"\" lists at the time. She was 17 at the time and I hope that they will not be the best roles of her career. If she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in TART, it very well may be.I\\'ve only seen Bijou Phillips in one other film (BULLY) and I swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here. I\\'m not sure if she\\'s incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar. My guess is that the former is true. I sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned. Here, she is the actress tapped to portray the watered-down Hilton sister. That she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with, and remains friends with, the real-life Hilton sisters. She\\'s essentially playing a version of herself in this film, and doing a damn poor job of it.As for writer/director Christina Wayne... I know nothing of her other than TART was her first, and only, film project to date. With a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short-lived.\",neg\\r\\n\"Let\\'s face it, a truly awful movie, no...I mean a \"\"truly\"\" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. I admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Species, etc. And although I\\'m giving this film a 1, I highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: Aussie Park Boyz. From the very first moments of the lead actor\\'s side to side eye-rolling performance as he attempts to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a slice of ham straight out of silent pictures--eat your heart out Rudolph Valentino) to the sudden hey-we\\'re-out-of-film conclusion, you...will...not...stop...laughing. To sum the film up, its a poor man\\'s Warriors down under, complete--and that description alone should be enough, but then comes the wonders of \"\"the spaghetti eating scene\"\", \"\"the \\'We\\'ve got their tickets; they won\\'t be leaving town now\\' scene\"\", \"\"It\\'s the Asians! Run!!\"\" and more. The only truly objectionable part is a gratuitously filmed rape. Outside of this, I dare you to watch this film. And I dare you to find evidence of acting, or lines, or direction, or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that so-called critics say a film needs to be judged as good. If this movie doesn\\'t cause fits of uncontrollable laughter before it ends, all I can do is roll my eyes menacingly from side to side at you and shout, \"\"You dog! You dog! You dog!\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"Unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by AIDS and his new young neighbor, a wanna-be tough redneck played to perfection by Brad Renfro. Although the story may seem slightly farfetched (the two boys attempt to river-raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to AIDS), the emotion, actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life. Being a \"\"big brother\"\" to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released, I strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS. Superb direction by Peter Horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. Added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.They all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie. Harvey Cormann\\'s first film, it shows a certain simplicity in movie making. To avoid expensive sets, actors go through curtains to enter and exit the house (ie the studio). The location shots filmed in the hills near Hollywood are the backdrop.I would not say this is worth going out of your way to see, but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s.\",neg\\r\\n\"Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James \\'Jimmy\\' Trivette, Walker\\'s sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.On this show, people don\\'t respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That\\'s not how life works, that\\'s not how people are. This show doesn\\'t take place in this reality.The plot lines are about as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people\\'s houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the \"\"bad guys\"\", act like he\\'s the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. The lines that sometimes come out of people\\'s mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. It\\'s as if the scriptwriter for the part of Wesley Crusher (for the \"\"serious\"\" parts) and the scriptwriter for Bob Saget\\'s funniest home videos (for the \"\"humor\"\" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.This show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. It\\'s for the elderly. It\\'s for wishful thinkers. It\\'s for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. It\\'s for people who want to drift away into oblivion. It\\'s for people whose drug of choice is their television.I cringe every time I see even a commercial for this show. My opinion is that it is THE worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.I used to like Chuck Norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. I can\\'t even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.\",neg\\r\\n\"One of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen. When I was trying to watch this I had flu and i was pretty open minded for any brainless entertainment. Unfortunately this was too much. How, so many totally ungifted actors can be in one movie? This movie makes porn look like European art-movie. Cast just speaks out their lines without any emotions; special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin) soon-to-be-ex-wife who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talk about the weather. Just horrible (and funny).With lots of booze and friends this might just make it as a background entertainment and few laughs, just like Ed Wood-movies. The plot is a joke and soundtrack straight from some cheeky soap-opera.Hopefully nobody paid to see this movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldn\\'t put down while reading.The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.You won\\'t have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn\\'t. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy. If you haven\\'t read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting. And if you have read the book, well lets say you might be a little let down because I found many scenes missing that I was looking forward to.Overall, Pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer. But, maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans.\",pos\\r\\ngone with the wind and scarlett are two different films they were never meant to be compared obviously the original actors in gwtw are all passed away and deserved their own separate award and praise i loved gwtw and never really expected a sequel to be made or ever live up to half the praise of gwtw but to my shock scarlett was just as well written directed and acted as gwtw scarlett in its own right deserves just as much award i now can honestly say i don\\'t know which i like better i think the script for scarlett was a- number 1 perfect\\' as a sequel. Bravo! writer director producer and all actors Bravo! AS sequels rarely live up to their name sake this one runs equal to its predecessor. To those who don\\'t like it you miss the point and a great ending to phenomenal beginning,pos\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know how I would feel if I lived in USA. I would watch some preview scenes, advertisements, I would know, Sidney Pollack directed it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starring in. I would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review. Would I be disappointment?I read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was: This is boring, long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting. Harrison is wooden, cold. The sublots should be cut. Too serious, particularly for Harrison Ford. I am interested in the subject, and I like Harrison Ford in the films which are not actions. I like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas too. So reading the reviews on IMDB website then in other sites then in February in the Hungarian movie magazines I was wonder and wonder what the film was. Anyway there are films, directors, stars what/who I want to see despite any reviews.I can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion, but I feel different. It is true I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French film, I don\\'t know what its title in English, or in French). Basic of these films is development of a love.I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way.It may be true that the sublots -the congress election and the cop\\'s investigation after a corrupt policeman- are not written well, are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character.After his wife\\'s death and betrayal emotion, angry of Dutch comes to the surface during his work. He will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend (then the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: our wife/husband\\'s death and cheating. One of them is the woman\\'s: this is tragedy, but the life is continuing. She doesn\\'t want to mourn forever. What she wants to know-what her husband\\'s lover-the cop\\'s wife- thought about her she will not learn never. She is forced to behave in this way. The elections are comes, and anything about his husband may become scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father. The man is a cop.He suffering from the fact he lived in lies. He wants to know -maybe every men would want to know in this situation-when his wife started to cheat him. How long had she got lover?. He needs the woman\\'s help but she doesn\\'t want, but the guy is stubborn and steady/persistent. The woman can\\'t stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget. Their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said it in spite of that they made love in bed) However the cop, can\\'t stop with investigation, can\\'t stop close and can\\'t allow the woman close to him but he starts the \"\"love\"\", and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But it can\\'t. The woman realizes it. The end is a bit sad, but logic, and nice at the same time.It was pleasant for me to see again Peter Coyote-I like this man\\'s face- Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt but she was good.I think Harrison Ford did an okay job. His eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally I believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament. It was pity he had not got any joke. But Ford has got a good sense of humour. A reviewer noticed (in Hungary): \"\"Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice. But Dr Jones is not smiling at us\"\".. But he smiles at the end and it is soooo good. With the rest I agree. I very like him in this role- He is good in acting of this a bit rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop.. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident, but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions. But she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop.The two cool, reserved- people find each other.Maybe the script is not good. It is full of common, banal sentence, but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man. It is a good film but not for everybody, not for the general big audience. I watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better. About the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn\\'t go to multiplex. Anyway I advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes, who like only Ford\\'s action films miss this movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"From the late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo act in films. During this time period, Laurel was definitely NOT among the upper echelons of talent and his humor isn\\'t nearly as good as contemporaries such as Lloyd or Keaton. However, for second-tier short comedies, he did create a decent niche. As far as the quality of the films go, they varied wildly. Some, such as DR. PYCKLE AND MR. PRYDE, were terrific, whereas most were of average to below average in quality.FROZEN HEARTS is an odd film. Like many of the films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path\\xc3\\xa9 during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-rate and the film looked very nice. However, despite this and having support from the likes of James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor. None of the jokes seem to work and the film looks almost like a drama, not a comedy. Only the really silly intertitle cards betray the type film it\\'s supposed to be.My advice is try to see all his Laurel and Hardy films and then see the solo films. In addition to DR. PYCKLE, try seeing THE SOILERS and MUD AND SAND--two of his more tolerable solo shorts.\",neg\\r\\n\"Red dust is both well acted and well made but what the movie is about i think will bore many viewers as it did to me. There was a film that was out earlier called \"\"in my Country\"\" with Sam Jackson and it was not that well received and both films were about nearly the same exact thing, I do think Red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor but the plot is just to lacking, it starts off pretty strong but then the film hits the viewers with countless un-interesting court room sessions, this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lacking. But see if for the performances.\",pos\\r\\n\"Jewel Thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing till the end who the villain is. Suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly concealed clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief. The story portrays that Dev Anand (Vinay in the film) and the jewel thief have identical faces. But you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally come to know the villain. There are many surprises and a lot of fishy stuff going on but there is time for romance and six melodious ever lasting songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi.This film was also talked about for its song\\'s videos. Consider the teasing and counter teasing in Asman Ke Neeche. Or the blocking of road by Dev Anand when Tanuja was going out with her friends in Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are Are in the beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance by Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add to it Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this film for any reason.Able acting by Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and direction by Vijay Anand (Dev Anand\\'s younger brother) makes this one of the best loved Hindi films of all times even today.\",pos\\r\\n\"Never having read or seen the Bard\\'s original work, I can\\'t begin to compare this work to his story. So I won\\'t. Instead I will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.\",pos\\r\\n\"The story takes place on the streets of Sao Paoulo in Brazil where a young boy named Pixote grows up alone without his parents. Left troubled and with no direction, Pixote gets taken into a child asylum with other adolescents from the street. Behind closed doors terrible things occurs within the staff and within the child-groups. And there is one last trigger that gets the place blown up, the last incident that makes Pixote and his friends decide to break out and escape. From there on begins a journey overwhelmed with strong bonded friendships, friendships torn apart, love and hate, criminal activities and simply chilling on the beach talking about things, something someone like you and I also does sometimes.I think this film is perfect in so many ways because it touches you on so many levels, it did that with me anyway. The document-like style used to portray Pixote and his surroundings does it seem more realistic, and the actors, who really are street children and have lived similar lives, helps the humanity in the conditions seem more natural. It has a social comment about child abuse too, but I think what makes the film so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political views. The last scene, which I find the best piece from the film, strikes me as something beyond nothing I\\'ve seen before. So full of emotions and yet so unsentimental makes this film a truthful, believable, unbearable, unforgettable story-tale. A true heartbreaking masterpiece which is so underrated!My vote: 10/10\",pos\\r\\n\"What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950\\'s. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don\\'t know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don\\'t think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good! What a difference in the stars from the 50\\'s to todays music stars. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly to Justin Timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?\",pos\\r\\n\"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say \"\"french culture\"\". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy\\'s brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn\\'t that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!\",pos\\r\\n\"I am so excited that Greek is back! This season looks really eventful. Im glad that Casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority.

They should shave Cappy\\'s head, as well. All the guys are hot but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I cant wait to see more of him!

He doesn\\'t know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him. After momentarily pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. He then enters a world different to the one he came from. As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking. As he takes his first lunch break, he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits. On this same day, he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes, of what looks like an act of suicide. The strange thing is, the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised, and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent. To help Andreas settle in, he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub. The club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night..and as Andreas drinks his sorrows aways, he realises that no matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. As he tells these observances to a stranger in the men\\'s room, a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on Andreas\\' mind all along. Realising that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house, and notes where he lives for future reference. The plot predictably evolves with Andreas wanting an escape. He seeks out the man he once followed...hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again...but is it too late?My thoughts: This norwegian film is something which everyone should see, as it holds the answer to the big question! What is the meaning of life? (well, close enough). The film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today\\'s working man (or woman). It\\'s sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic. It tries to show that small clich\\xc3\\xa9 things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, is the moment you\\'re one step away from becoming a robot. The ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you\\'ve now become used to. You start to adopt the saying of \\'if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\\', and become too comfortable to take a risk of change.Even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism...its message is more than real. The lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and that of which Andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. The director, Jens Lien has put together a film, which in any other director\\'s hands would have failed. This is a fine piece of cinematic genius, and i eagerly await to see what he does next.The lead role, played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag is perfectly cast. Representing the average Joe, Trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous. The supporting actors also do an apt job, and for some reason, i feel that Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this film, as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless.The score for this film was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a delight to listen to, and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie.Set for a release date in the UK for 25th May 2007, i will definitely be going to re-live this experience on the big screen. This film has gained its way in my top 10...now quickly becoming my top 20! It has some shocking scenes, and is darkly humorous throughout...A MUST -SEE!!\",pos\\r\\n\"Dan Burgess is a nice guy.

It documents 2 days in the lives of a group of young people, bored with their everyday existence and dead end jobs and taking ecstasy at raves on the weekend. It is hilariously funny and extremely poignant, and at times very sad. In the same genre as \\'Trainspotting\\' it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising British stars. The movie was made on a miniscule budget and I look forward to future offerings of Writer/Director Justin Kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers.\",pos\\r\\n\"In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man surprisingly well-made--though mindless--little horror. Throw in a little buddy-comedy, nice gore and intense scare. It\\'s hard no to say that Monster Man is really entertaining. The low budget seem pretty obvious, but it doesn\\'t effected the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shame.Yes, the plot somewhat generic as possible. Pair of friend, Adam (Eric Jungman)and Harley (Justin Urich) are driving cross country to interrupt the wedding of a woman Adam has always loved. While Adam is more nerdy type, Harley is a self-proclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth. Adding a bonus to the plot, then they picked up a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them. When dead body starts counting, they must do the race against the time before their own life on risk.The plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies, but Michael Davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension. The scare is build well enough, where characterization is never be the best, but fairly okay. The script also littered with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale. It\\'s hilarious and shocking in the same time, which is pretty amusing.As conclusion, Monster Man surprisingly entertaining. It deserves more attention in the big screen. It proves that big budget doesn\\'t make an effective horror movie, but skill does! Something that the director has shown and delivers.\",pos\\r\\n\"Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don\\'t even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend\\'s house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.) Well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. The thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. It\\'s just a cheap, poorly done rip-off of Evil Dead. The whole \"\"story\"\" seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. I have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I\\'ve seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS!!!) (shudder) I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films.Fun fact: This film is like a cockroach on steroids! Much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. Kind of scary huh?\",neg\\r\\n\"I can remember reading that Darwin had a pivotal experience in the Galapagos islands, seeing the vast range of animal life there, and intern, penned his theory of evolution. Not according to this movie-it was inspired by the British countryside. OK, and as John Cleese would say-Right-. I also did not think that Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish. According to this film he was. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness, but I don\\'t think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much. Well, not according to...you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable, and to an extent this film comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable, which to me, is just plain gross. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry, cool and calm, and always thinking logically. This film seeks to dramatize the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration. It is like a Canterbury Tale. I would not recommend it.\",neg\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say that, but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have EVER seen.Due to its name \"\"Darwin\\'s Nightmare\"\" i expected a documentary on problems relating to the Nile perch in Lake Victoria.What I actually saw in this \"\"documentary\"\" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake. And for a large part you can hardly call them stories - it\\'s more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection...Why does this movie waste time on: - Showing us non-relevant information on the families of the Russian pilots (several minutes are wasted for example on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters) - Mourning the death of an African child who got bitten by a crocodile (as if that could not have happened without the Nile perch) - Showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport - Showing us strange religious events for several minutes - Discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - Talking to kids about their mothers, fathers - what they work and/or how they died (well, guess what: some died of HIV - who would have guessed that?) Those are just some examples, i could go on for several pages...This movie is absolutely unfocused, and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer. If you have never heard of Africa and have no idea that this continent has Social/Health/HIV/Violence/War problems then this movie might be right for you. If you haven\\'t had your eyes closed for the last decades 90% of what this movie shows won\\'t be new to you - and the way it\\'s presented here will try its best to make you fall asleep.Perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high, but i really didn\\'t like it even though this is a topic that I would generally find interesting. If this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the Nile perch, than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter...\",neg\\r\\n\"Volcano\\' is a B-movie at best, and at worst is more of a disaster that what it\\'s supposed to be depicting. To be fair, you have to be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for one major concept. \\'Volcano\\' asks you to suspend disbelief in science, human interaction, and common sense.Tommy Lee Jones gets to be the studly-yet-1990s-sensitive head honcho of the Office of Emergency Management, and he\\'s fine when he\\'s not stuck with the stupid dialogue the script provides. However, Anne Heche gives a howlingly bad performance as a smart-ass geologist who becomes Roark\\'s love interest (while the city is burning down, natch). Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and American President to a turn as a whimpering, needy, and victim-for-life daughter of Jones. Don Cheadle gets to sit in a really coooool office and take Jones\\'s phone calls, doing the job that in reality Roark would and should be doing.Anyway, the movie really starts going downhill when Heche\\'s geology partner gets sucked into a lava vent while they\\'re breaking into the subway lines. It picks up speed when Jones starts suggesting that they use buses to dam the flow of the lava flowing down the street, Heche\\'s geologist (who loves to lecture everyone about The Science Of Geology) being apparently oblivious to the fact that lava is hot and it melts metal, and rock, and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect. It really starts to suck when the film introduces Rodney King-like racial tension between two bad actors dressed as cops and an angry black man who can\\'t understand why the fire department is busy with this large river of flowing lava. But hey, in the end, the three of them will be working together to build a K-rail dam to stop the lava from eating up his neighborhood, even though the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used wouldn\\'t stop lava anyway. Besides, K-rails are hardly watertight, but I guess lava wouldn\\'t think to poke its head through the gaps, not when Tommy Lee Jones is glaring at it. Don\\'t even get me started on the stranded-subway-car subplot, where a tunnelful of hot lava is coming down but oddly enough, it\\'s not too hot to attempt a rescue, it\\'s not too smoky to see, and there aren\\'t any poisonous gases so everyone can breathe. This must be LA Lava, or Lava Lite. You know, it eats cars but is eco-friendly.There are moments of sheer camp here that almost make you wonder if this was meant to be a comedy. For instance, the two security guards packing up Hieronymus Bosch paintings have a completely meaningless and farcical conversation about weight, and at the end, no sooner does the little boy Roark/Jones rescued note that everyone looks the same while covered in ash, than a rainstorm breaks out and cleans everyone up -- and then the sun comes out and Heche says something along the lines of, \"\"aw, shucks, Roark\"\".\\'Volcano\\' almost achieves Battlefield Earth status, but except for Heche no one approaches Travolta-like badness and the technical aspects are handled pretty well. If you are from the LA area as I am, it\\'s kind of funny to think of a lava flow wiping out Wilshire Boulevard. I gave it a three for the effects and the little amount of tension you get from this.\",neg\\r\\n\"Alexander Nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to lamentation and end in a triumphal cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic Knights in a battle on the ice of Lake Peipus.The film is a splendid historical pageant which shows director Sergei Eisenstein at his most inventively pictorial, and climaxes in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998), and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds, and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential Soviet-made historical film.\",pos\\r\\n\"I swear, I had never seen such a bad movie as Half Caste is. Not only because it just makes no sense, is a huge piece of egolatry and self-confidence that makes me puke.Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish Apocada has a similar pronunciation to \"\"apocado\"\" which means \"\"out of life and happiness\"\") makes here a one man army movie thinking he is Sam Raimi or the boys who directed the Blair Witch project. This is the Blair Kittie project, with an expensive low budget.The story, a couple of American Filmmakers that go to Africa to make a documentary of the Half Caste, is just no-sense. The way of filming, inserting high speed shots with slow motion shots, just revolts your stomach more than the stupid lines (what the hell is that dialog about Bestiality?) or the lame performances. By the way, I don\\'t believe this cast (or caste?) is American, they all look European to me.To finish this, just say that the filmmakers made an intelligent move about selling the movie. They put a fake award achievement (as most original film) and a nice cover (in Spain the cover had the Half caste image in negative), so I feel now unhappy, because I can\\'t demand my 14 Euros back.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is movie is garbage, it looked really funny on the previews but I didn\\'t laugh once through the whole movie.

I couldn\\'t stand this show as it revealed itself. I can\\'t speak for everyone - after all some people actually like that IDIOTIC show \"\"Stacked\"\" (which makes me wish to vomit). I can imagine those who like \"\"Stacked\"\" might actually like this drivel, too. Some people still get a kick out of the old \"\"pull my finger\"\" gag. To me, this show is just about as witty - and just about as original.The themes were old and tired. The jokes were lame and hackneyed.

Now it\\'s easy to explain why it didn\\'t live up to expectations: Firstly, this show failed to create a realistic world of pre-teens in the way that Rugrats captured the world and the imagination of toddlers. Secondly, the show\\'s character\\'s are stereo-types (Angelica: white spoilt blond as opposed to Suzie: colored girl from modest family,...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and annoying (Dil). Finally, there is not one ounce of innovation or an original plot-line. To sum up, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel series to a show such as Rugrats. It\\'s boring, lacks imagination and it seems that the producers don\\'t even know how 10 to 13 year olds behave. To be accurate, shouldn\\'t Angelica and Suzie be comparing bra sizes rather than fight over who\\'s better at doing chores?\",neg\\r\\n\"Looking for something shocking? Okay fine... the imagery is that. That\\'s about it. This film attempts to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolism and just ends up being annoying. I am not quite sure if the director\\'s purpose was to truly portray some sort of deep message to his audience, or if he just sought to shock the hell out of them with gore, sex and violence. I am thinking that it was probably the first...but in the failed attempt..it simply ended up to be a piece of artsy garbage with lots of blood, some obnoxious characters, and an over reliance on religious symbolism. If you\\'re looking for some independent film to critique for its attempted use of metaphor...have at it. If you are looking for a gore flick that will make you queasy and uncomfortable... here you go... If you are looking for a film that will irritate you to no end because you realize that in the end, the message was stupid...the movie was stupid... and you will never get those minutes of your life back..this is surely the film for you!\",neg\\r\\n\"As I write this, no user reviews are in yet, but there are 17 votes with a 4.8 average, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. I didn\\'t notice any, and even if I had I don\\'t think I could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them.A common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science, police tactics, and the like so common in B movies should detract significantly from one\\'s enjoyment. I tend to fall into the \"\"Yes, that\\'s a reasonable reaction\"\" camp -- especially when the mistakes are central to the plot. With this movie, I look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess. They completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside of B movies, that is.) In short, I can\\'t think of any non-trivial thing they got right.Any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, able to disappear into another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion. (They don\\'t make ghosts like they used to.) Combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"It\\'s the best movie I\\'ve watched this year! Excellent detail and storyline (for a remake).It presents to you a \"\"what if\"\" situation wherein the island of Japan could totally be wiped out of this earth.

It also presents a great and genius solution to this massive tragedy.Horror, action, suspense, sci fi, documentary, love story and all the human interest story you can get you\\'ll find everything here! But I also warn you that it is a real tearjerker! The casts, actors and all are all excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! The thing is...this could really happen to anywhere on earth! Now let me ask you this after you\\'ve seen it...\"\"what would you do if you are faced in this life and death situation\"\"?\",pos\\r\\n\"Watched the director\\'s cut last night...glad it was free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at \"\"film noir\"\". The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, not clever, seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. The \"\"non-traditional\"\" casting I also found distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder \"\"what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there?\"\" then the storyteller has failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating, and very film school final project-ish. And for pete\\'s sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color. There was no use of nuance in the lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture...just black and just white...boring!\",neg\\r\\n\"It is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie.Imagine King Kong being recast as an organ grinder\\'s monkey and Fay Wray\\'s part being played by a young boy.

Another good book is The Winner by David Baldachi.\",neg\\r\\n\"Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way).Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clich\\xc3\\xa9s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early 20th century.For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it\\'s hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: 1) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character.2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer\\'s cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where he seems downright stupid.3) Custer\\'s promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.4) Custer\\'s stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.5) Custer\\'s drinking problem is certainly not ignored.And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I didn\\'t expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this.And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way.All in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk.\",pos\\r\\n\"Being Belgian myself, I take interest in the history of Congo. It has been our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and it is part of our country\\'s history. Nowadays it seems to be very popular to say that all that the Belgians did to Congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. I\\'m not saying that bad things didn\\'t happen. Of course they did, but back then this wasn\\'t abnormal. Do you really think the French or the Brits were that much nicer in their colonies? No, they weren\\'t. It was \\'normal\\' at the time for our king Leopold II to use Congo as a way to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (it didn\\'t belong to the state then) and he tried to make the most out of it. Of course gruesome things like hands being chopped off happened and yes to todays standards that\\'s inadmissible, but in those days it was common practice. And it has to be said, all this didn\\'t happen anymore during the last decades... I know several people who have lived an worked in Congo for many years before the declaration of Congolese independence. It\\'s true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and I really can\\'t imagine they ever treated them bad. For as far as I know they have always treated them with a lot of respect (However, I\\'m not saying all Belgians did). In fact if they weren\\'t that old now (almost all about 80 years old now) they would love to return to Congo.The good thing about this movie is that it gives an historically accurate vision on what happened during the last years of Belgian governance and the first years of Congolese independence. The story isn\\'t as black and white (perhaps not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean) as I feared it would be. It doesn\\'t say that all the Belgians did was wrong and all the Congolese did was good. It shows perfectly how the Congolese, in their rush of getting independent from the Belgians, didn\\'t mind to accept help from the Russians as well as the Americans, who both had more eye for the raw materials like copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber,... and getting the Congolese in their political \\'camp\\' and weren\\'t all that interested in their independence. It does not only give a good idea of how Lumumba became more powerful, but also how Mobutu played a double role. It shows the Belgian reaction on some of our compatriots being violated, threatened and even murdered (My father was one of the paratroopers who were send to Congo to rescue the Belgians). It gives a good idea of the political problems Lumumba encountered as the province Katanga didn\\'t want to be part of the Congolese Republic, the role that the Belgians had in the murder on Lumumba ... it all gets it\\'s part in this movie.The story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and act like the real ones. This movie has been able to give a very good idea of what life in Congo in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by everybody who is interested in the history of the country. But it should also be shown in history classes, especially in Belgium, because it\\'s a part of our history that should never be forgotten. I give it a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends one year in Barcelona. During that time, under the influence of all the new impressions, he changes and grows. Upon return, he has a much clearer view on his life and finally takes it into his own hands.This is one of the most moving films I\\'ve ever seen, and the reason is probably that I\\'ve been in a very similar situation. I\\'m from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, but I can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an Erasmus semester in Spain will do to you. From what I hear the story is autobiographic, and that\\'s probably why it is so realistic.Let me give some examples (mild SPOILER alert) - Xavier shares a flat with other students from Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and England. The flat looks EXACTLY like all the Erasmus shared flats I\\'ve seen in Madrid. The main characters are nicely developed, and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who remained in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all relationships break up during an Erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). - There\\'s a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his flatmate from England who is kind of \"\"uncool\"\", to go out with all the others. He finally succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of her life.Another great thing in this film is that it\\'s truly trilingual: The students in the flat speak Spanish or English, and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so that everyone can understand what\\'s being said. I surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywhere.I can imagine that for non-Erasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy, but for all my fellow Erasmus I can only say: This is YOUR film! If you haven\\'t seen it, do so. But be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia...10/10\",pos\\r\\n\"There are movies that are so bad, they\\'re good. Then there\\'s movies like Rest Stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.Bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. I can\\'t even bring myself to write a plot outline because all I really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favour and don\\'t even bother with this film at all. It\\'s 1.5 hours of your life that you will never get back. 1/10\",neg\\r\\n\"Slaughter Trail is a B western with some grand pretensions. But it\\'s come down in Hollywood history for a most ignominious reason.Watching this film with it\\'s musical score which can only be described as overbearing, I have a feeling what Howard Hughes was trying to do is recruit a singing cowboy for RKO films. They already had Tim Holt who was as reliable a B picture cowboy hero there ever was, but he was not a singer. I guess Hughes saw what money Herbert J. Yates was raking in with Roy Rogers over at Republic and decided he\\'d get one as well.So Terry Gilkyson who was a very good performer and much better song writer got recruited and sang some of his material which was not his best and worse, looked like they were shoehorned into the picture. But worse than that, there\\'s this annoying chorus which sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors, extras, even the horses. Needless to say Terry never got to be a singing cowboy. But he did write such classics as The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin\\'s great hit, Memories are Made of This.The plot concerns an inside woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery. That\\'s right, the outlaws who are Gig Young, Myron Healey, and Ken Koutnik plant Virginia Grey in the coach as a passenger which they receive word is carrying some valuable jewels. It\\'s a great act Grey and Young pull off. Young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they do properly act out the scene within earshot of the passengers, but what he does is slip her the swag. Last place the authorities might look, if she doesn\\'t run off with it.But when they flee the robbery it\\'s on tired horses so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement mounts and shoot three Navajos who object. That puts the Navajos back on the warpath, didn\\'t help that one of the casualties was Chief Ric Roman\\'s brother.That\\'s the situation that Captain Brian Donlevy at the fort has to deal with when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection. How it all works out is predictable, but in a gaudy sort of overproduced way.In fact that\\'s the problem with Slaughter Trail. It\\'s a simple no frills B western that got souped up into something almost grotesque.But the real reason Slaughter Trail entered into history is that this film apparently marks the official beginning of the blacklist. Originally Howard DaSilva was to play Donlevy\\'s part and may have in fact completed his scenes, when Howard Hughes officially fired him for Communist sympathies. His scenes were completely re-shot with Brian Donlevy in the lead.Considering what a fiasco this film turned into, I\\'m not sure whether Donlevy or DaSilva ought to have thanked Hughes or kicked him in his private preserve.\",neg\\r\\n\"For me this movie was a disappointment. Somehow I expected that it would explain the reason for General Rommel\\'s popularity and his success as a military strategist in WW II. But there is none of that, it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries, in a way, to whitewash him. So I just have to suppose that Rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business, without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour. Such real life people just do not make good movie material. I almost feel sorry for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character. Actually, a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie \\xc2\\x96 with the exception of Luther Adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of Adolf Hitler.There might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German speaking world. Famous British actors impersonating Germans are just not credible. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not just as a German but as a typical \\xc2\\x84Southerner\"\" from Baden-W\\xc3\\xbcrttemberg. You immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain kind of wit, a certain way of seeing the world (the total opposite of eg a Prussian \\xc2\\x84junker\"\"). I also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of July 20th, many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the German troops to join the Western Allies against the advancing Bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever).The best movie portrayal of an intellectual, intelligent military mind is in my opinion still Patton (1970). Incidentally, General Patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie, a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles. The open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible!\",neg\\r\\n\"Ugh. Pretty awful.Linnea Quigley gets top billing, but her character doesn\\'t have a big part. Who is her character supposed to be anyway, the little boy\\'s aunt? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie, it was a head and shoulders shot. Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie.Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell, and Brinke Stevens, though. Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog. No other characters are in the scene with him, though he\\'s sort of composited in, or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else. There\\'s also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket (it looks like a bad photocopy), and a decent picture of him in a family bible. He conjured up Jack-O originally, or something like that.Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie he\\'s showing \"\"The Coven,\"\" in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe. Evidently there\\'s more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch/The Brides Wore Blood.Jack-O: what\\'s it about? Darn if I know. A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer, and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin-headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people, or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things, and actually kills people.There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family, with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too: ancestors of his, I think. I think they figure into Jack-O\\'s backstory, but I\\'m not sure how.The little boy is ostensibly the main character, but we don\\'t really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses, has nightmares, and will fight bullies even if he\\'ll get beat up in the process. More time should have been spent establishing his character. I couldn\\'t have cared less if he died.Not recommended, not even for Halloween.\",neg\\r\\n\"...means \"\"take up and read\"\", which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff\\'s 1995 New Yorker article of the same name.

This is a great movie.,pos\\r\\n\"Mr. Brento wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the Dragonball Z TV series. Of course not.This is a Hong Kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the Japanese original cartoon (which was also based on a comic book series). And I really don\\'t know if it was produced under the license of the Dragonball creators...However, the story of the monkey-boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over Asia (in Japan, the name of the boy in the tale is Songoku; in China, it is Sunwukong; in Korea it is Sonogong; etc) and the story in Dragonball has much to do with that tale.By the way, as I said, this movie is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (which was followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the US version had a different airing order). And all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series (without so much overacting and so much insistence on it!), but because of your comments I may suppose they were completely removed in the American dubbing.Anyway, I agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is.

Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and pointless \"\"Harlock Saga\"\", while Galaxy Express 999 suffered having this hack of a movie stapled to its name.If you\\'ve seen \"\"Queen Millennia\"\", you\\'ll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a sequel to this already concluded chapter, also finding a way to suck at doing so.This movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie, mixes it with badly paced melodrama, and to add an insult to an injury, tosses in some of the most renowned characters from Matsumoto\\'s universe.The only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork, but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it can\\'t save this movie from being a total loss.If you\\'ve enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie. You\\'ll thank me.\",neg\\r\\n\"I must say I didn\\'t expect much about this movie, but it turned out not to be bad at all. Most striking of course, was Aidan Quinn\\'s performance. I would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero. The great thing about it is that he really builds up his character (Annibal). I mean, it was not like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis would do it, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he\\'s really upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich\\xc3\\xa9s were avoided. When Annibal gets his training, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average American would do in such a situation, ask what the f*** is going on and refusing to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional marine officer, he doesn\\'t give up and he tries not to lose his courage, in which he succeeds pretty well, except for a brief break-down on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I\\'m glad that Aidan Quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him (in fact two, because he plays the villain as well), even although the film wasn\\'t that successful.\",pos\\r\\n\"Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly something bad has happened to Ron Howard. I don\\'t know what exactly, but something has gone very wrong.Howard has always been a decent workman director. While he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films, Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequel/sequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun romp. In addition none of his films have been downright awful. (Note I have seen neither How the Grinch Stole Christmas nor his newest film Heidi Montag Says No to Plastic.) Whats more Howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven Oscar bait (A Beautiful Mind), star driven costume drama (Far and Away), star driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash).Angels and Demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film. Scenes are too dark, camera angles are all wrong, the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus. This makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled.Dan Brown gets picked on a lot but I found The Da Vinci Code a fun readable romp (so sue me). The movie version of the Da Vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting.Angels and Demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of Vatican City and since Howard wasn\\'t allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a CGI back lot. The entire film is as if Rick Steves did a Vatican City special and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and pointing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased.While the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again sue me), Demons and Angels story consists of a plot by the Illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly. Oops my bad; apparently the Vatican doesn\\'t need any help on that one.Anyway their plan is to infiltrate Europe\\'s Large Hadron Collider, kill the head priest, and steal three vials of Anti-matter. This begs more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-matter once created? Why is the EU collecting it? (Perhaps they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why is the head of Anti-matter gathering a Vatican priest? Now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world\\xc2\\x85 no just kidding; unfortunately the Illuminati haven\\'t quite grasped that Pinky and the Brain level of sophistication just yet. Instead the current pope has just died and it\\'s conclave time. The top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing them one by one Seven style. They being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some Latin themed Riddler. Oh and the last kidnapped Cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn\\'t found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there was some Latin themed Batman to save the day\\xc2\\x85? Okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told, but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. A true character study\\xc2\\x85 (Okay you know where this is going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope\\'s personal assistant/cabana boy as an Irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his Lucky Charms.On the plus side Stellan Skarsg\\xc3\\xa5rd puts in a fine turn as head of Vatican Security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its Vatican critics in at least one area.\",neg\\r\\n\"Was really looking forward to seeing a continuation of Lonesome Dove but this was total garbage. Cinematography was terrible. Shot way too tight. Was almost viewing the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. Editing was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. Don\\'t know if McMurtry did the screen play but the dialog was terrible. Really like Val Kilmer\\'s portrayal of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp but what in heck was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon??? I have no idea. Even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove gone so wrong with this? Where was his head.............. Can\\'t say much for the acting either. It\\'s a shame to have messed up such a beautiful western that could have been but more like they rushed this one just to get it in the can. Have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way. Not even curious to watch the next few nights cause it would be just a waste of time like the first night was.(2nd post)..................OK, since nothing else was on TV I must be honest and admit that I watched the last 2 nights of Comanche Moon. And I will be honest to tell you that I didn\\'t make it to the end of either of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I was watching the two main characters very closely and I could pick out some mannerisms that Steve Zahn did while portraying the character that Duval did such an excellent job with. So I must give Zahn credit for that. As for Karl Urban\\'s portrayal....simple dead meat. Can only say again that I was very disappointed only because I cared so much for the original LD and like others .......have defended my feelings for a truly great western.\",neg\\r\\n\"Cardiff, Wales. A bunch of 5 mates are deeply bored in this town. There\\'s Jip who works in a clothes shop. Coop, an easy-going DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing: the week-end. At this time, they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music, they experience different drugs, particularly ecstasy. Then, they usually continue the party to a friend\\'s. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the feelings are the following ones: tiredness, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night...Surfing on the wave of the notorious success of \"\"Trainspotting\"\" (1996), this debut movie written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation about the notion of hedonism. It means: how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time. Indeed, as I have previously written, for the 5 main characters of the movie, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure (besides, Jip in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting oneself: you are numb, you don\\'t feel any pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth. Kerrigan\\'s relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and care freeness of the 5 protagonists. They only live to take advantage as much as possible of an hedonist week-end. Furthermore, to spice up a little more the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes, Kerrigan isn\\'t afraid to include dreamlike sequences which represent his characters\\' fantasy or embarrassments. Then, \"\"Human Traffic\"\" (1999) is also served by a particularly bouncy sound track. The amount? A perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music. At last, this week-end of euphoria enables to shelve momentarily the usual drab image of the popular social classes, British cinema has studied a lot.Notwithstanding, when a movie (conscientiously or not) exploits the fame of another famous one, it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor. \"\"Human Traffic\"\" is in this condition. There\\'s little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless digressions (Jip who, in the nightclub goes in the manager\\'s office and tells him a cock-and-bull story so as to enable Moff to enter the club but that\\'s no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems). One can also blame Kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved. His movie can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole aren\\'t virtually explored. It\\'s a shame! It could have conveyed the following message: even in the happiest moments, there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them. The same remark could also be said when Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina broaches a guy.It may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the DVD cover but \"\"Human Traffic\"\" is to be taken as a good and incisive little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the twentieth century, a will to have fun without ulterior motives and trouble. An ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it. The theme is very timely. It was on TCM this morning and I am wondering why this wonderful film is not on VHS or DVD. I have searched extensively for this movie but cannot find it. I believe that if enough people request it, the movie will ultimately be put on DVD. It amazes me that such a stunning performance from Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike. This film is a great teaching tool from the past yet in many ways as contemporary as \"\"Crash\"\". From previous comments I can see that this film as made deep impressions on everyone. Again, too bad it is not available for sale.\",pos\\r\\n\"Ah Animorphs. I loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when I heard that there was a television adaptation, I was very excited.Boy what a let down the final product was. I think for me, this was the moment when Nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more generic.So what was wrong with the series? Let me count the ways: 1. The characters were HORRIFICALLY miscast. In the books, the Animorphs were somewhere between 12-14, the television cast were at least 18. I remember being horrified when I first saw the cast photos.2. Horrific acting/bad writing. I dunno which was to blame so I\\'m lumping into the lumpy mass that it was. Perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because Marco - not funny. In fact, I don\\'t remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few. The actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head smackingly pathetic at its worst.3. My lord they were stingy with the budget. The final result of the Andalites alone should have convinced Viacom to pull the plug...Their heads had clefts that clearly showed which was the helmet.4. Back to the cast - Rachel by far was the biggest let down, far from being the warrior woman in the books, the best equivalent in the TV series was \"\"scarecrow\"\". Also, I know Cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between \"\"idealist\"\" and \"\"idiot\"\".5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Did the music have to be THAT obvious? 6. Answering question 6, \"\"yes\"\" because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldn\\'t the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap-rock rip-off or whatever the hell that was.Since then, there have been bigger let downs (Iraq, 2004) but in case I haven\\'t made myself clear - this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from.\",neg\\r\\n\"\"\"Purgatory Flats\"\", shown on cable recently, is a small movie that packs a lot. Harris Done directs with style. The screen play by Mr. Done and Diane Fine makes a good thriller.If you haven\\'t seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading.The film is the story about a young L.A. doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it. Upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten. Bad choice! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Right after landing a job as a bar tender, Thomas meets a pretty young woman, Sunny, who, clearly is someone to stay away from. The young doctor is called to help as Sunny\\'s boyfriend Randy, is gunned down by a drug dealer.We get to know Randy\\'s family. His uncle Dean appears to be OK, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile Sunny.The performances are fine. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who should have gone to his L.A. practice instead of making a detour to the small town. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, Brian Austin play the men in the Mecklin family well. Nicholas Turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer.The film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film.\",pos\\r\\n\"I have now suffered through Parts, The Clonus Horror.To have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror.The story was about a cloning-central owned by the \"\"The man\"\" They grow Clones for harvesting organs from the clones later on for the original humans in need of transplants. One clone escapes, The government gets angry and kills all involved, but the story somehow leaks out anyway.It is Truly Shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs such as Fiveson. The only thing he genuinely succeeded in doing was to weave in the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect, what makes a human a human, and would it be OK to grow clones for organic harvesting? Sadly, mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left town, until the very end in where a pathetic attempt is made to sum it up.But!! What disturbed me the most was the introducing of new characters lacking actual relevance for the plot. Despite that, Fiveson feels the need to kill them off in a bad explosion which only Sir Coleman Francis Himself would be proud of.The setting was interesting. How Fiveson thought that pulling out sheets of plastic and running water over them would make a believable river is beyond me, but I guess if you were to compare the setting to Coleman Francis\\' gray pasty oatmeal of a setting, this film would win.Perhaps Coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10\",neg\\r\\n\"I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. While watching the movie I had the feeling that I have seen a movie with a similar story before...a movie with Ray Liotta but I can\\'t remember much of it. Of course, this one is a lot more dramatic, especially at the end.This is the story: Emilio\\'s life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain. After 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go.Watching Emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing...the affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesn\\'t. Despite that the movie is still funny, exiting and involving. Either it makes you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him. I liked the analogies, photography and the good performances.7.5 out of 10.\",pos\\r\\n\"This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad\\'s ship. However, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned. The inevitable ensues - our lad falls for the mannish Moran and she for him. In the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united. Some interesting dialogue points out that Moran belongs to no man -\"\"and no woman.\"\" (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive either. Valentino does well in a romantic, action role. His sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one. He is very appealing. This is no great film but it passes the time. What it really showcases is Valentino\\'s beauty and sexiness.\",neg\\r\\n\"Beautiful art direction, excellent editing and wonderful stories make this some of the best television ever produced. The fact that it was relatively short lived is sadly reflective on the state of television. I highly recommend snatching these up as they\\'re released, you\\'ll love them.\",pos\\r\\n\"this movie is trash because, out of many reasons, it is based on Mark Furman\\'s book, which is also trash. let me must say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight - and others that right this type of trash belong in jail. for the movie itself, being based on the book, was horrible as well. the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related, thru his aunts marriage, to the Kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders - they are just a family and middle America needs to get over the obsession. this poor guy, and his family, have been hounded by the police for years, they couldn\\'t get tommy so they went after Micheal. its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he Didn\\'t do it, besides the facts that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have kept this trial from being brought back after TWENTY years for the love of god, don\\'t watch this garbage\",neg\\r\\n\"In a world full of films -- like \"\"You Got Served\"\" -- that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors, you\\'d never figure that there would be worse films... until now. Ron Hall\\'s \"\"Vampire Assassins\"\" does more than cheese you off. It KNOWS that you are mad at it. First: there are no assassins in this movie. In fact, there\\'s only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. Second: The location... is basically one location: some jackass\\'s house (or basement. It\\'s up to you.). Third: The special effects (bluntly stated) can kiss my ass. Fourth: The acting beats \"\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\"\" in the worst-acting-ever category. Ron Hall can\\'t act to save his life. Finally (and definitely not the smallest problem): THE EDITING. The person who edited this film better hope that I never find him. The cuts and shots are HORRENDOUS!!!! Other issues: Lighting (virtually none), the fact that the guy on the cover isn\\'t even in the movie, and the fact that this film exists.To sum this film up, let us just say that I tortured the DVD copy before taking it back to Hollywood Video (don\\'t worry! I used the MVP membership, so it was free!). NEVER SEE THIS FILM!!!!\",neg\\r\\n\"I don\\'t understand why it is so underrated on IMDb.. This movie is just the perfection.. The better adaptation of all times of the myth of Tarzan! As a french, I can say that this is the better role of Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in a lots of movies, but here absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is great, well told, the story magnificent, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, every things are perfect! How believe these sequences with the Elgar music, just simply perfect..Greystoke is truly an unbelievable movie, underrated here, I don\\'t really know why, but really appreciated\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'m a big fan of the \"\"Vacation\"\" franchise, and I love Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and at least a couple of the behind-the-scenes names were involved in this project (most notably Matty Simmons, who produced or executive-produced all 4 of the theatrical releases, as well as \"\"Animal House\"\"). For those reasons I figured this made-for-TV spin off might be worth checking out, even without Chevy Chase.For the record, I did not expect it to be very good; I just thought it might be a slightly amusing diversion. Therefore, my high level of disappointment goes to prove just how bad this utter turd of a movie really was. It was mind-numbingly, jaw-droppingly, heart-stoppingly, head-explodingly terrible. Yet, somehow, I could not stop watching it. It\\'s a sickness I have; I can\\'t seem to walk out on a film or give up on a TV show before it ends. Nothing has ever made me want two hours of my life back more than this movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"Closet land is not at happy movie. Neither is it connected to any kind of social realism. This is perhaps its strength. The distance from specific time and nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful and rips away the burden of nationalism and propaganda you often sense in movies made to criticize nations in opposit of ones own (I am of course primarily speaking of the USA propaganda in some commercial film).Bit closet land is so much more than a message. It is a film of pure, surrealistic beauty, filled with the same clean, clinical form you find in work such as 1984 and it\\'s equals.I am of old a big fan of Alan Rickman, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, I might add, the uncomparable sex-appeal ;-)). The outplay between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Everytime I see him, he seems to play a character even nastier than the last one...But, enough sweettalk. The film lacks in action. I dont want any crashing cars, but I want something to happen, except pure talk. After an hour I got really tired of the interrogationroom, the predictable actions and more than anything I wanted a more complex view of it all, the world, the former lives of the characters and all the rest of the framework that was missing. For some people a nice touch. For me something less positive.Anyway, Closet Land is a movie worth it\\'s time if you are ready to make a trip into the abyss of the human nature.And of course for us who really loves the Always Evil Alan Rickman.\",pos\\r\\n\"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show \"\"Fridays\"\")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it\\'s also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he\\'s done, he\\'s ashamed, but he\\'s also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains. There\\'s a few subplots like Jekyll\\'s fianc\\xc3\\xa9e, who is the daughter of the head doctor at Our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll\\'s employer. And there\\'s Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few \"\"real\"\" parts and a taste for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes, and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants, including testicles. Yeah, the humor is raunchy and silly, and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless, but if you\\'re not above a quick wallow in the gutter, you\\'ll probably like it just fine. Now available on DVD too, for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'ll give it this: I didn\\'t stop watching, and it\\'s not corporate, which is kind of cool. But my internal critic cut it to pieces -- I suppose I see too many movies. Wooden script, the slang just sort of clanks out of their mouths without any kind of flow. Editing, mentioned before, is hit and miss; sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel, but mostly its irritating -- jerky, quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups. The actors were marginal, though Letisha had her moments.I\\'m not sure why the audience supposed to care about Curtis, he\\'s a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing. The directing doesn\\'t help make you love him or hate him, even; I just wanted him to shut up and get shot already. I didn\\'t care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around. The completely predictable ending isn\\'t credible at all. I\\'m not sure why we\\'re supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he deposes are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams. \"\"Oh, you just got out of jail and are on probation? Here\\'s thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, go run it around the corner for me. Now don\\'t steal from me, etc.\"\"A good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but it was let down in the end. Handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow-raising, if only mildly interesting. There are better movies in this genre that don\\'t insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film-school offering. 4/10, an F.\",neg\\r\\n\"I am a firm believer that a film, TV serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor- as to when written, produced or conceived-should be taken in to account.Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching it in the mid-80\\'s on TV and the re-runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90\\'s. and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. That made me buy the full series DVD set and surprise of surprises- the comedy and the moments of the good \\'ol days simply fell flat for me. Even the very popular \"\"30 years ka experience\"\" \"\"GULAAAAB JAMUN!\"\" and \"\"Sofa cum bed\"\" did not invoke the kind of mirth I thought it would. The timing factor: for the 80\\'s, this was the showstopper. The main event. The mother of all TV comedies. And it worked during the age and time! Perhaps the same cannot be said right now, but nonetheless, watching the DVD did bring back pleasant memories.I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat were longer. Satish Shah has been un-believably good as the heart of the show, with equally effective support cast of Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and the bengali neighbours. Rakesh Bedi hams throughout.All in all, an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during the prime times, might not appeal to the younger viewers or first time watchers!\",pos\\r\\n\"If you are thinking of going to see this film then my advice is - dont.For me the film failed to make the grade at every level and was a reminder of how dire most British (& Irish)films are. Forgettable tripe is the best i can say. If it had been on telly l would have wandered off to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I saw this film with a group of friends and having read the press previews went along prepared to not be critical and hopefully pass an amusing 90 minutes. But, oh dear.....As a comedy it wasn\\'t funny, as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. As a love story totally unbelievable. Most of all as a piece of \\'gloriously over the top whimsy\\' it lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they needed to do to earn their money playing er..... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but other than playing east end gangsters and jack the lads, does Michael Caine leave you cold?In fairness, some of my friends thought it was \\'ok\\' but if you do go, my advice is have a few drinks (or puffs) beforehand and leave your critical faculties safely locked up at home.\",neg\\r\\nIt\\'s clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it\\'s entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!,neg\\r\\n\"Wow !! I didn\\'t even know about this movie until I was searching for the name of another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are better left unknown. Mark Hamill\\'s role is quite ... limited. I would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in those bad horror b-movies of the 60\\'s and 70\\'s. In those movies, they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. Memorable acting by Mark with such great lines as \"\"Don\\'t try to run. You\\'re under arrest.\"\" Did I mention he says that EXACT thing more than once. Bill Paxton fell into an Uzumaki type spiral of drugs and booze after Aliens, because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session. The HAIR .. the HAIR !!! .. Priceless Bill. Truly should have been \"\"GAME OVER\"\" for Bill .. but somehow .. he got treatment .. and went on to better??? movies. This movie blows. It is more dull and boring than The Crazies. At least that movie was crazy... this is just boring. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE SOBER.\",neg\\r\\n\"Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films (although it doesn\\'t fit into that genre itself) - the rise and the fall. We see the rise of several individuals, some of them from complete obscurity, to achieving great heights ... and then falling from grace due to their excesses.I believe that this is the first feature by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it\\'s a great start! I saw elements of other directors\\' influences, such as Robert Altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development.Character development is the movie\\'s finest feature. I really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All of the performances were brilliant. (It was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, Nina Hartley).Basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the Oscars (probably due to the \"\"racy\"\" - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the Academy.\",pos\\r\\n\"I just went to see this movie with a friend. I quickly looked and read a short synopsis and thought it sounded interesting. We came out the movies not feeling very sure if we liked it not.The acting was good enough and connection with characters was OK. The main character I thought acted a lot like someone like Van Helsing. Yes it was pretty entertaining.But the plot I felt like it was used from other movies. The script was a bit weak, I\\'m not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character says \"\"Oh my god\"\" every time.The special effects worked well, but (sorry for this spoiler) the main monster at the main climax reminded me a lot of the Balrok out of Lord of the Rings.Overall, the movie was OK but I felt like it\\'s been done already. Go and see buy all means but don\\'t expect too much.\",neg\\r\\n\"When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie as Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies. However, this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too. You can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long. So I can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list. It may work for some people, but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build-up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie. Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses. The premise of the movie had potential, as did the casting of Quaid, but all of it just sputters and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary. Granted, the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a whirlpool of blood was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror, instead of one that lists comedy as its first genre.\",neg\\r\\n\"Believe me I wanted this series to work, but the early departure of Kevin Kilner dealt a near death blow after season one. Robert Leeshock just wasn\\'t right for the part and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point. I don\\'t know what happened in Season Five, what a mess. Sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull, if you know what I mean. The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict. If not for their talents and well-written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man-chicks in a B-movie series.If only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by SyFy...\",pos\\r\\n\"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film\\'s glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film\\'s \"\"sanctimonious traditionalism\"\" and its \"\"glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness.\"\" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman\\'s final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than \"\"fascinating fascism.\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"Like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven\\'t seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. I don\\'t think it\\'s a worse film than Delicatessen but it\\'s a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again. There is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you. There may be a distant similarity to the films of Kusturica, but he\\'s really in a different league, so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on Tuvalu.\",neg\\r\\nAndrew McCarthy played the role of an atheist very well. I liked the plot of the movie. It gave something to think about other than a comedy. It had a very twisted mind and a good cop versus God. A very well used plot line.,pos\\r\\n\"This Film was one that I have waited to see for some time. I was glad to find it has been everything anticipated. The writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience. I found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant. The film has many stories and characters woven together around this one Character Kilo , a Man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in Prison Kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems. Kilo Finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and Political royalty in order to make clear how important a Man\\'s Word is and stands for. A war begins as the street is in arms against Lords of wealth and corrupt Power.A build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns. This film will leave you riveted. I found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a Movie to be ignored. Excellent. Go Rent It Today!!\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie has been advertised for over three months in Greece as the biggest Greek production ever. Well, it could be, but... When you hear of a big production you expect to see something new, something different. What you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence. George Corraface looks like he didn\\'t really enjoy making this movie. His acting is so simplistic, that looks almost amateur. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (dubbed?), is full of hiss. The, thankfully few, special effects showing Istanbul and Athens in the late 50\\'s and early 70\\'s are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (age 5) up to 1968 (age 14), but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later.So much for \"\"the biggest Greek production\"\". At least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production. And all one gets is a love story between 7 year-olds, who meet again 40 years later. Oh, there is a political side, too. A couple of ironic remarks about the Greek \"\"junta\"\" of \\'67-\\'74, so childish that seem almost forced.There are, of course a couple of good things in the movie: most of the actors are great, mainly Ieroklis Michaelidis, the very good scenery and the magnificent music by Evanthia Remboutsika; but they are so few for such an expensive production.Bottom-line: Is it so bad a movie? To tell the truth I don\\'t know. I just know that in no point does it justify its huge (for Greek standards) budget.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is by far the most awful movie I have ever watched. I have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10. My advice is don\\'t watch it. This doesn\\'t even classify as a movie.You\\'d be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie. Acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline. Highly unlikely sequence of events which aren\\'t even funny. They are actually very lame and stupid. Very foolish choice by Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid to act in this movie. Might even upset their careers a little.When I walked into Blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie , so I decided rent it. I sincerely regret it.Once you\\'re 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen. I was hoping it would get better , but instead it got worse.I am not exaggerating this. The movie is terrible. Don\\'t watch it. Hope this helps.\",neg\\r\\n\"For those who remember this video\\'s initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a viewing of Thriller is all that\\'s needed to feel twelve years old again. But, while it\\'s a great video, it\\'s not perfect, even though it seemed like it at the time. When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before. Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choruses. After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for its previous absence. This may have been the first time a song had ever been deconstruct to fit the visuals in a music video, but it certainly wasn\\'t the last time. It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV. The best videos, like Jackson\\'s Billie Jean and Beat It, have used visuals to serve the music, not the other way around. Still, Thriller is great fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.\",pos\\r\\n\"I really couldn\\'t get into this movie. The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed. She dies and he is left in the basement to starve. Months must pass and a family moves in. The daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father. Well anyway this guy in the basement, who for all rights should be long dead is still around. He eats a cat and now is superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a hooker dies father gets the blame. I always dislike movies where someone else is blamed for the killings because you always here the typical lines \"\"I didn\\'t do it\"\", \"\"I could never do such a thing\"\", blah blah blah. And the family storyline could be a lifetime movie storyline.\",neg\\r\\n\"A beautiful reflection of life\\'s desperation and misdirection of finding love.

Until next time...\",pos\\r\\n\"When I was 8 years old, and going through my Marx Brothers phase, my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film, \"\"The Big Store\"\" late on Friday night, and set the VCR to tape it for me. When I woke up on Saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide -- my father and I discovered \"\"The Story of Mankind\"\" had been recorded instead.\"\"The Big Store\"\" was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century\\'s finest works of cinema when compared with \"\"The Story of Mankind.\"\" I can almost justify TV Guide\\'s error, in that the Marx Brothers -- Groucho, Chico, and Harpo -- appear in both movies. Although in \"\"The Story of Mankind,\"\" they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo plays Isaac Newton????? Harpo\\'s scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Groucho\\'s scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today\\'s standards. The rest of the movie doesn\\'t bear mentioning. They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day, and made them recite total garbage. What a disappointment.TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I\\'m still waiting for an apology.For the record: \"\"The Big Store\"\" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates, and a couple of songs by Virginia O\\'Brien. I was really looking forward to seeing it.\",neg\\r\\n\"Once again, I\\'ve been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I actually put my shoes on, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing. I\\'m telling you, this one\\'s not worth the minuscule kilo-calories spent on lifting one\\'s index finger to switch channels on a TV remote. I even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a pedigree dog-pile. These presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is a. going senile or, b. is only marginally interested in the film he/she is obligated to create. I saw similar deterioration with John Carpenter\\'s string of ridiculous caricature\\'s over the past number of years.Here are a couple of scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest is having a disturbing dream...supposedly a harbinger of nastiness to come since he seems hell bent on opening the archaeological feature which houses the demon. The dream is a goofy collage of disjointed images right out of the Twilight Zone\\'s stock footage. A ticking clock careens through the dream scape\\'s blackness implying, what?, the unfathomable mystery of Time?....big deal! A disembodied head, painted in demon features with convenience store quality Halloween make-up, flickers back and forth in a convulsive frenzy. Every time I see this effect, a big fat rip-off from Jacob\\'s Ladder, it pisses me off. This, in itself, almost instantly discredits a film. The whole build-up of the archaeological dig itself is laughable. Everything is so obvious...so tired and over-wrought...the only possible response is boredom. At one point in the dig, the priest comments on finding the statues of Angels surrounding a sarcophagus...they\\'re all pointing down toward the crypt with their weapons. He queries \"\"Look at these surrounding statues....It\\'s as if they are holding..something..down!\"\" This is supposed to build tension...critical mass..but it doesn\\'t even come close! How can there be suspense if you treat the audience like a bunch of morons having to EXPLAIN the suspense as you go along. The imagery is over-done in the first place but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion. Soon thereafter, the tomb is \"\"decorated\"\" with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another shameless rip-off of The Keep, btw). Who, for crying out loud, did the make-up effects for this film??! The blood actually had that pinkish quality one might see in 70\\'s Tromaville flicks. At this point I became almost convinced that they simply forgot the make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money.DON\\'T listen to glowing comments on this one! I\\'ll be keeping a suspicious eye on Schrader too. Looks like it might be time to hang up his gloves. Perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle admonition to quit while there\\'s still dignity in memory of films gone by.\",neg\\r\\n\"I thought sleeper cell was interesting, and exciting to watch, up until the last episode, when nothing happens, its F****** BS, you Americans portray Muslims as terrorists, and the Americans as hero\\'s, its the other way around, i hate it when every American TV show ends up predictable, i was hoping the bombs would go off in that stadium, but i knew it would\\'nt, it takes the joy out of watching it when you know that the good guys are going to save the day, yet again, Americans are the biggest terrorists, g bush the leader of them all, he is to blame for 9/11, and I\\'m P***** off that you keep throwing these shows at us, which are all the f****** same! i\\'ve a good show about terrorism, its called \"\" The Whitehorse\"\" and bush himself the cell leader, its the same with 24, how ever 24 was good, sleeper cell is a mock and should never make a season 2, its F***** joke! and so are you American producers.\",neg\\r\\n\"I was still living with my parents when they aired this on dutch TV.

So we were watching this and my dad ( the most emotional of the four of us) started to cry. I followed almost immediately and before long my sister and mother were teared up too. There we were, totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good cry, this is the one for you!\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'ll have to admit that I\\'m at a disadvantage here; when I learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself, then that\\'s a problem. Although the plot of \"\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\"\" seems generally straightforward, the movie allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery. By the time we get to the scene where a witchy looking woman establishes the secrecy of \"\"the first degree of the seven fold ray\"\", I didn\\'t know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I missed something.In retrospect, the cryptic note retrieved by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the handle of a shaving brush was a craftily written message, leading to a dentist named Barbor, and eventually to the Albert Hall, a place, not a person as indicated by \"\"A. Hall\"\". But for all the intrigue, it\\'s never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated. Okay, so Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Come to think of it, why was the note even written and secured in the shaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen?With it\\'s disjointed scenes, \"\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\"\" is hard to follow and a bit disorienting, however I\\'ll give Alfred Hitchcock credit for this early effort. For perspective, I\\'ll have to watch some of his other work of the same era, though this movie certainly can\\'t hold a candle to his later works like \"\"Psycho\"\" or \"\"North by Northwest\"\".\",neg\\r\\n\"I got seriously ripped off with this purchase.

Anyway, first of all the guys are hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy etc.Secondly, the girls are cute, sexy, smart and are not afraid of being called bitches. I like that. Which at the same time doesn\\'t make them mean and greedy, just realistic.Third the relationships are so great, especially Casey and Cappy. Lately every show turns very away from it\\'s original path and people end up with someone who wasn\\'t even in the first season. Cappy and Casey\\'s relationship is true love, a kind that lasts. They loved each other throughout the years and it didn\\'t end when a guest star appeared. In todays world maybe it\\'s kind of unbelievable for two people to love each other for a long time but it happens. And people define each other in college so I knew exactly who I wanted to be with in college. Just like Casey and Cappy.

Love this show\",pos\\r\\n\"Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on screen as the Masked Man in director Lesley Selander\\'s epic adventure \"\"The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold,\"\" co-starring Jay Silverheels as his faithful Indian scout Tonto. Selander was an old hand at helming westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit. This fast-paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of Native Americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since 1950 in Hollywood oaters after director Delmar Daves blazed the trail with the James Stewart western \"\"Broken Arrow.\"\" Racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald screenplay. Having written 13 episodes of \"\"The Lone Ranger\"\" television series, Schaefer and Freiwald each were thoroughly familiar with the formula, but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing. Our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of Indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason. The mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don\\'t have to guess what is happening.Although the violence in this Selander saga appears tame by contemporary standards, the fact that the Lone Ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a dastardly dame slays a double-crossing accomplice by hurling a tomahawk that sinks into his back between his shoulder blades was pretty audacious. The television series never went to this length, and when the Lone Ranger wielded his six-gun, he shot the gun out of the villain\\'s fist rather than blow him away. The other discrepancy here is the Indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information, but they are never brought up on charges from abducting this henchman. Douglas Kennedy didn\\'t have the villainous statue of Lyle Bettger who menaced the Masked Man in director Stuart Heisler\\'s \"\"The Lone Ranger,\"\" but he acquits himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a qualm when the miscreant threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful Indians.\"\"The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold\"\" opens with a recap of the masked protagonist\\'s origins as an ambushed Texas Ranger and his transformation into the Lone Ranger with Tonto serving as his sidekick. This opening two minute refresher is an excellent way to get a series-oriented character off to a start so that everybody, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is on equal footing. The primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing hoods and called\\xc2\\x97not surprisingly\\xc2\\x97the Hooded Raiders begins with them killing Indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a baby hidden nearby. Taking the baby and the dead Indian, they ride to a nearby Spanish mission supervised by Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody of \"\"The Outsider\"\") and turn the infant and body over to him. Initially, the Padre has to assure an Indian maiden, Paviva (Lisa Montell of \"\"Gaby\"\"), that the masked man means them no harm and is their friend. Padre sends Tonto off to town to fetch the doctor, Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks of \"\"Gun Fever\"\"), and Tonto promptly runs into trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawman, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of \"\"Giant\"\"), who abhors Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating prisoners in the sheriff\\'s jail and Matthison\\'s men start to rough him up when Rolfe intervenes and rides back to the mission.Eventually, the Lone Ranger and Tonto are able to capture one of the Hooded Raiders, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara of \"\"Drum Beat\"\"), and his fellow braves abduct the henchmen and take him back to their village. They stake him out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue. Chief villain Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of \"\"Hell\\'s Crossroads\"\") and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of \"\"Devil\\'s Canyon\"\") ride out to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured henchman. Little does Brady know that his henchman talked. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive not long afterward and reprimand Redbird for his perfidy. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the Lone Ranger decides to adopt a disguise so that he can learn more. He masquerades as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux Southern accent.Despite its concise 83-minute running time, \"\"The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold\"\" lacks neither excitement nor surprises. Selander keeps the action moving ahead at a full gallop. The dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable as Schaefer and Freiwald push the plot ahead more often than spring surprises, but there is one major surprise that ties in with the good Indian theme. There is also a scene where the Lone Ranger pushes his own credo about justice available for everybody under the law at a time when Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren had embarked on the high court\\'s landmark decisions that recognized and mitigated against the conditions surrounding racial segregation, civil rights, separation of church and state, and police arrest procedure in the United States. One thing that differentiates \"\"The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold\"\" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of the Spanish conquistadors with a slight bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. Generally, Lone Ranger stories confined themselves to the 19th century without dragging in European history. No, the Lone Ranger wasn\\'t the first movie to deal with Spanish conquistadors. Robert D. Webb\\'s \"\"The Seven Cities of Gold\"\" (1955) concerned the Spanish searching the southwest for the eponymous places, but Selander\\'s western beat Gordon Douglas\\' \"\"Gold of the Seven Saints\"\" (1961) to the screen.\",pos\\r\\n\"I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I lurv Steve Buscemi.I remember when I first saw Buscemi\\'s full length directorial debut, \"\"Trees Lounge.\"\" I enjoyed the movie, although it wasn\\'t as good as it could have been. It was -almost- there. It -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see \"\"small\"\" movies about \"\"small\"\" people in \"\"small\"\" bars that are in \"\"small\"\" towns. It was close enough to where I would say that it was a very good movie - one that with a few tweaks could have been great. But that\\'s OK. I like the movie and I\\'ve watched it more than once.But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It\\'s about \"\"Lonesome Jim.\"\" When I saw the description of the movie and then I saw who\\'s movie it was, I was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that I knew that Trees Lounge could have been. But what I actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy, heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation.In other words, this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that I wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state - the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning, or if you happen to be the floozy, waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile. The film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with store brand white bread, no less) and the emotion of a cadaver. I am not sure what the point of this film was, and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission. Sorta like those new cars that don\\'t come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I\\'m not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). Overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film. I mean, Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. I blame a lot of this on Affleck. Why do people keep casting these Affleck turds? They suck the life out of anything that they are connected with. One Affleck was in one decent film (and wasn\\'t even the reason why the film was decent) and all of the sudden every butthole named Affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script. People pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two duds together don\\'t have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum, but oh Steve you let us down. This film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper.\",neg\\r\\n\"toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (C.

That movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see. It\\'s the best ever society critical movie. The ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down.

There are a couple of places where I had no idea what just happened, it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how you\\'d got there.

Not a great movie by any means, but definitely a fun one.\",pos\\r\\n\"Not quite a bomb? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium. Actually the script \"\"may\"\" have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors, but the dramatics of an aging Diane Lane acting as if she was a teenager (or even a twenty-something) was too much to stomach. Every time she (Adrienne) would jump into the arms of Richard Gere and then pull both heels up behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking, \"\"Oh, my aching back...this babe sure doesn\\'t weight 125 lbs. anymore!\"\" Anyway, both characters were distinctly unlikeable, especially Richard Gere\\'s: a self absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) that was on some kind of \"\"soul quest\"\" after a botched operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband (at the husband\\'s request) when he meets up with Adrienne. She is recently split from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach-front cottage rental. Of course, that\\'s where Dr. Flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling MADLY in love (especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor AND a plastic surgeon). In between romantic interludes and a nauseating song/dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (no CD\\'s?), they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up. Dr. Flanner was also not much of a father and has a son (who is also a Dr.) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up. (Naturally Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous, distracting boy.) To make a long (predictable) story short, Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going in for a \"\"routine\"\" cyst removal of the face). Dr. Flanner is FINALLY able to tell the husband (played excruciatingly sympathetic by Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist. \"\"I told him she was too old for that much juice!\"\" Glenn\\'s character,(Robert Torrelson) appears to accept Dr. Flanner\\'s apology. It\\'s hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good Dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow. Ever more circumspect, Dr. Flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship. Unfortunately, that means he must temporarily bid adieu to Adrienne. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to Adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. Evidently, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wife\\'s death was the second hardest thing.

Director Jay Craven (who also co-wrote the script with Don Bredes, based on Howard Frank Mosher\\'s novel) and cinematographer Paul Ryan crafted this powerful story with unique, contemplative pace/visuals, which remind me of Terrence Malick\\'s and John Huston\\'s best moments. It\\'s an underrated independent period piece of the first (electric) half of the 90\\'s, usually regarded as the rise of Quentin Tarantino\\'s burlesque (\"\"Pulp Fiction\"\" is a masterpiece indeed, but the man suffers from Orson Welles\\' Syndrome), Todd Solondz\\'s disturbing suburbia, Danny Boyle\\'s dark vision of the UK (let\\'s not mention that \"\"Beach\"\" flick with DiCaprio, though)... Jay Craven should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well. He\\'s been leading a respectful, discreet career and it\\'s always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his.My vote: 8/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie was sooooooo good! It was hilarious! There are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were awesome as Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love those guys!

I love singing along with all of the songs!\",pos\\r\\n\"James Marsh\\'s The King is a film that mystifies me. I can\\'t think what its meant to be for. It\\'s a story about a young man called Elvis played by Gael Garcia Bernal who gets an honourable discharge after 3 years Navy service and then goes off to find his biological Father and behaves dishonourably with him and his family. It\\'s all rather sick really. Elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister Malerie (Pell James). It\\'s rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in Middle England. Preacher Father and bouncy joyful Christian Congregation; I couldn\\'t work out whether the film is meant to be deriding them for their mindless beliefs. Or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that\\'s unviable. OR is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction. It\\'s shallow. We all know that bad things happen; the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just gratuitously depicts a violence without ever unravelling the thinking that has led to it. \"\"The King\"\" is such a lost opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honour; the Warrior Code; the changing concepts of valour; honour killings in Indian families and so on. Honour is a very varied concept. But this film just adds nothing to the notion. However, Paul the Projectionist did more than his meagre role suggests. The DVD Projector showed all films in a green-only hue and the only way to repair this was to get it sent to Belgium. He did this through Christmas. I think those postal workers and repairers and Paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this dismal film. But you might see it differently?\",neg\\r\\n\"With boundless, raw energy and an uncompromising vision, Talk Radio brilliantly explores the public\\'s fondness for reducing strangers\\' private problems into entertainment via the radio.Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine, a rude, in-your-face talk radio host. He\\'s a natural for this kind of role, and fine tunes one of the most impressive, interesting radio personalities I\\'ve ever seen on screen. The timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius.Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry\\'s boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992\\'s Glengarry Glen Ross. But the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned, seemingly brain-dead teen played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it.Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with the photography, which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcasting room. The claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone. After all, one of the major points of the film is exploiting people\\'s private moments to draw an audience. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience.Talk Radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact - the likes of which are seldom seen today.\",pos\\r\\n\"This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I\\'d recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord! It approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way - without cheaply capitalizing on all the \"\"gohst\"\" and supernatural themes that have become staples in Hollywood and the TV networks.\",pos\\r\\n\"Is Thursday an original film? Heck no, but it is a lot of fun! I just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick. I was expecting much but what I got was some interesting scenes (I really liked the first seen at the convenience store), some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well. Some good performances from young actors, Paulina Porizkova was good and I was particularly impressed with Aaron Eckhart (who has gone on to impress me further in \\xc2\\x91Yours Friends and Neighbours\\' and \\xc2\\x91Erin Brokovich\\').

After seeing it, I\\'m convinced that no matter how much it\\'s written how he extensively researched the film, Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography ? Give me a break. The game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there ANYTHING in this movie that wasn\\'t brought up in \"\"North Dallas Forty\"\" ?Aging star player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... check. Owner who doesn\\'t \"\"get it\"\" .... check. Crazy off-field behavior .... checkAlso, it\\'s the playoffs in Dallas (i.e Dec or Jan) in an outdoor stadium, yet people sitting there in tank-tops and shorts ! And what was with those lights ? Were they playing in a Japanese Kabuki theater or a sports stadium ?And the strategy shown in the game was laughable. It\\'s fourth & 1 inside the \"\"Sharks\\'\"\" 30. Dallas leads 35-31. KICK THE FRIGGING FIELD GOAL. Not only would this had made sense football-wise, but you\\'d then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two-point conversion. Hell, tie the game w/ the extra point and Stone could have made it an even 3 hours with overtime.Were the lame montages of \"\"old time\"\" football players supposed to be a tribute to the game ? Give me a break.And the script ... ugh. More cliches than you can shake a stick at .. oops, there\\'s another one.\"\"Slapshot\"\" was better than this movie.

I grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. The others I watched this movie with also agreed. The acting was annoying. I am tired of Jim Carey\\'s over the top ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way. I actually disliked the leading characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. I am trying to recall one scene where I or anyone I was with laughed and cannot. A worthless movie and a total waste of time.\",neg\\r\\n\"A fun romp...a lot of good twists and turns!

Basically they took a bunch of one-liners from various Shirley Temple movies, threw them together, and had Orr act like Shirley Temple acted on-screen. \"\"Oh my goodness!\"\" was said quite a number of times. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you will recognize several lines direct from her movies. The trouble is they have Orr saying these in Shirley\\'s everyday life. In the end, what we get is a hodgepodge of re-created Shirley Temple movies, instead of any sort of real look into Shirley Temple\\'s life. Save yourself the trouble and rent Shirley Temple movies, it\\'s a lot better than watching Orr try and recreate Shirley\\'s acting style.\",neg\\r\\n\"(Only light spoilers in here)Stealing Sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims, and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time.You will see some poor performances all around in this movie. The drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. Whether you\\'re watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won\\'t shut up, or a victim\\'s father responding to the criminal\\'s death threat with \"\"Care for some tea?\"\", none of it is believable. This quite comfortably fits into the \"\"wannabe movie\"\" category.You will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. It\\'s quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. It\\'s really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.However, if you\\'re able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline.I voted 4/10.\",neg\\r\\n\"I love the book. It\\'s full of passion, romance, tension... and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a major star in Australia, having starred in Neighbours and releasing her first single. The decision to cast her in The Delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. For me, it didn\\'t pay off.Kylie may have been great in Neighbours, but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty Lola... and, she wasn\\'t of Asian descent as Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie.By and large, the movie was boring. It dragged on, it lacked the passion of the book, it focused heavily on Kylie and in general, was completely disappointing.\",neg\\r\\n\"This joins the endless line of corny, predictable 50\\'s sci-fi shlock out there. As usual, it\\'s pretty bad. There isn\\'t much of a plot that I could detect and the over-exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs. The title is misleading also.

It is by far the movie of all movies . The romance between Scarlett and Rhett made people dream all over the world and turned the lead actors into cinematographic icons . One can ask , is it really necessary to make a sequel ? And ... there are some big shoes to fill .Well , there was the book first . \\'Scarlett\\' by Alexandra Ripley is , we have to admit , well-written and fully respecting the world created by Margaret Mitchell . She picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently leads us from Mitchell\\'s heritage into her own fantasy . In the book Scarlett , defeated after Melanie\\'s death and Rhett\\'s leaving , travels to Charleston to reside with her mother-in-law in hope of regaining Rhett\\'s love . Her typical manipulative behavior evokes once again a lot of criticism from Rhett and drives them further apart ... until a certain boat trip that will change everything . Scarlett now carries a secret . The series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of Scarlett in Ireland . From then of , book and series slowly split ways . The actual end differs , but of course the both have Scarlett and Rhett back together .The production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next Scarlett O\\'Hara . Many countries made their own television shows featuring young actresses auditioning for the part . Eventually , about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in Atlanta , Georgia . Unfortunately , the producer found no Scarlett amongst these actresses . Sad for the girls , major publicity for the show ( it was already sold to many television stations worldwide before shooting even had started ). Robert Halmi , the producer who bought the rights to \\'Scarlett\\' , told he discovered the right actress while watching TV , gave her a call and two days later signed the deal . Joanne Whalley-Kilmer ( who starred in\\'Willow\\' and \\'Scandal\\' , the latest being the movie Robert Halmi was watching that faithful evening )is not Vivien Leigh , but she certainly is Scarlett ! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh\\'s , she makes the character her own . The major difference between GWTW and \\'Scarlett\\' is the fact the lead character evolves and grows as a person . This is the series prerogative , why copying something that has been done before ? Considering there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and second storyline , it is natural that both authors emphasize on different aspects of the characters . Whereas Mitchell works around Scarlett dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting for Tara , Ripley lets Scarlett face her demons . This to me , is the most interesting aspect of the series , we get to know Scarlett in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants . I totally agree with the choice of Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler . He portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than Clark Gable\\'s performance . The rest of the cast was well chosen . Julie Harris is endearing as Rhett\\'s mother , John Gielgud gives a very amusing performance as grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean is always at his best playing a dirty character , his Lord Fenton makes no exception . Poor choices however with Stephen Collins as Ashley and Ann-Margret\\'s adaption of Belle Watling was a waste of money . Costumes , sets and locations are elaborate and convincing . The newly built Tara set looked exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house appears for the first time .Is there a point in making a sequel ... Well , six hours of romance are to me . One to watch !\",pos\\r\\n\"This is species already hatching into a beautiful model (Mathilda May). A smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill!The movie begins with a strong launch, and infected by a bore-virus throughout the middle to end.The weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot/story. As you should have compared it, Natasha Henstridge\\'s Species got the same plot, but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong clymatic ending.This explain why Patrick Stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cage, floating inside Halley-Comet.A must see for a science fiction fans.\",neg\\r\\n\"I agree with the user \"\"SpecialAgentFoxMulder\"\" that this episode is awful- posisbly thr worst of the entire show.

As for the ending, I\\'m sorry but it disgusted me more than any other episodes combined.I mean, the boys think they meant well but the ending was so upsetting- that they think the whale belongs on the moon and over the credits, we see it has died. Wht could have saved the episode was if the pranksters were able to confess for what they did.There seem to be no outgoing message. Okay, South Park may be guilty of preaching too much and its always nice to see an unpreachign one (such as Make Love Not Warcraft\"\") but this episode was just wrong! Avoid at all costs!

I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you have read the book or seen the 1995 BBC version (and liked them), you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then. My friend however, who had seen neither, was mildly amused by the film. If you are a JAne Austen purist though, or even a film-goer who dislikes historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit through this.Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors wouldn\\'t have fared half so badly if they\\'d had a decent script, perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved Austen\\'s work.What travesties were committed? Well, you\\'ll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as \"\"Don\\'t you dare judge me, Lizzy!\"\" and \"\"Leave me alone for once in your lives!\"\". Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane Austen\\'s eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the Regency era? The usage of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the book. The writer also decided to give characters lines that, in the book, were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose. Worse of all, when they do try to stick a bit closer to the book\\'s writing, the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen\\'s phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words. It was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script. Stick to Austen\\'s words; she did it better than you! I assume all of this was done in a \"\"revisionist\"\" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 BBC version. However, for me, it also made a travesty of the true spirit of Austen\\'s most beloved work.The casting did have potential, though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in. But Keira, giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him tolerably handsome enough, misread his script and was under the impression he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy. I really did enjoy Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really rather refreshing.Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and I must say it is an apt description. And can somebody tell me why they fashioned Wickham after Legolas? Though he was in the movie for under two minutes, I daresay, and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie.On a wardrobe note, I would kill for Miss Bingley\\'s dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century. (A sleeveless Regency evening gown? Please! More Versace than Austen, that is sure) And poor Keira, all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I\\'m sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they didn\\'t catch him soon enough to comb the actresses\\' tresses before filming rolled.In short, with this new Hollywood version, bid adieu to Austen\\'s eloquence, subtlety and wit because you\\'ll be getting the complete opposite.\",neg\\r\\n\"I would label this show as horrendous if it weren\\'t for the fact that it\\'s on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and getting renewed while AD got cancelled. It is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show actually is. But let me try and describe it. Take an extremely low rate Archie Bunker and have him spout out humor that would have been out of date if it were on Married with Children. Then take great plot lines from AD (son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them. If you watch this, I will have completely lost respect for you, as should your family. However, if you are a fan, you should love FOX\\'s new comedy \\'Til Death. Looks like real funny, cutting-edge stuff. I mean, married couples not getting along ... brilliant.\",neg\\r\\n\"In the beginning, with the careful, remote location and sweeking metal sound, I thought of the opening scene in \"\"Once upon a Time in the West\"\". When it gets to the city, then it begins to feels like \"\"Kitchen Stories\"\", or \"\"Drifting Clouds\"\", even possibly \"\"Grimm\"\".Then it turns out that this is more similar to \"\"Joe Versus the Volcano\"\" in theme (not style). And the movie executes from beginning to end the same, understated style. Letting you observe, take in the steel, blue-grayish tone of the suites, dresses, wall color, furniture, bedsheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people\\'s expression. Then near the end, there is one shot of a completely different tone - warm orangeish-yellow with soft music and ocean splashing, children and laughter.But maybe the observation is too long for me, I would much rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the ending shot. Still beautifully done.\",pos\\r\\n\"I am partly a fan of Miyazaki\\'s work. I say \"\"partly\"\" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki\\'s recent film \"\"Howl\\'s Moving Castle\"\". An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on things go down hill. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films.Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. What is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version I saw was an Nth-generation copy, with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused.\",neg\\r\\n\"The most obvious flaw...horrible, horrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined with bad dialogue, continuity problems, things that were never explained, gaping plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere, and just plain stupidity. Not to mention the awful, cliched directing of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could\\'ve saved this movie. So it didn\\'t matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give horrific performances. The thing is, they\\'re better actors than this movie would have you believe. The best of the Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperately Seeking Susan) has some fine moments - like a great scene in the beginning when she painfully pulls her handcuffs off - but gives an overall weak performance, by her standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, When Trumpets Fade, and the brilliant My So-Called Life) is much worse, acting with no conviction or emotion what-so-ever. But I won\\'t lay blame on the actors, who have been good in other roles. The script is awful, and the bad direction doesn\\'t help. Do me a favor...avoid this movie.\",neg\\r\\nWidow hires a psychopath as a handyman. Sloppy film noir thriller which doesn\\'t make much of its tension promising set-up.

This movie has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a \\'not so well known\\' London.The movie is held completely in \\'dark\\' colours, which I personally don\\'t like too much. Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat. Other than that, there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots. FINISTERRE doesn\\'t glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city, but rather gives deep insights in what London is really like. From the East end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the \\'special little retreats\\' for Londoners.All in all:+Great Soundtrack +Nice shots +great insights-Narration -Tiering to watch at times -Very dark pictureWorth watching!

Nevertheless, I did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery & all; but, the story-line was very weak and I couldn\\'t really see the point of it all. However, the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the lackluster film.Where did the guys -Nate & Noah Cryns- who wrote this music come from? They are awesome!! From the moment the music begins, it is by far, better than anything I\\'ve heard in years. I think it may be the best I\\'ve ever heard! Even though I wasn\\'t thrilled with the action taking place on the film, the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene. I was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like I was re-living those old days through the music.This movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again.\",pos\\r\\n\"More of a near miss than a flop, MR. IMPERIUM stars Ezio Pinza as Alex, heir apparent to and later king of a small European nation, who falls in love with a willing American actress and entertainer, Fredda Barlo (Lana Turner), but due to machinations by the sly prime minister of Alex as king, nicely played by Cedric Hardwicke, the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in Palm Springs where their love is rekindled. Director Don Hartman, who also scripts, is not able to fully utilize his talent for snappy dialogue because of Pinza\\'s tentative English usage, and the requisite rewriting, coupled with less than total rapport in evidence between the two stars, results in a somewhat raggedy tone to the screenplay, exacerbated by the studio\\'s unkind cutting of many scenes, leading to a confusing ending. The overpowering Pinza dominates his scenes with Turner, but both performers score with good work, while Marjorie Main is impressive with her patter effects as written, with Debbie Reynolds placed on track by Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN\\' IN THE RAIN as a result of her sprightly performance here; only Barry Sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cutting. Prettily filmed largely in Pebble Beach, California, and other Monterey County environs, the film is endowed with Pinza\\'s iron strong operatic basso in Solamente Una Vez, as well as with original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, with Douglas Shearer splendidly handling the sound recording, and notice must be made of the fine set decorations by Edwin Willis, and the effective costume designs by Walter Plunkett.\",pos\\r\\n\"Billy Hughes is a mute young lady working for make-up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in Moscow by an American director. One night Billy gets locked in the movie studio. Later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out.

After escaping the clutches of the murderers, Billy informs the authorities, only to be red-faced when the men show it was an act. Billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance.I don\\'t know how this heart-pounding sleeper passed me by, but I thought it was a much older flick. There\\'s one thing though, it\\'s got to be one of the most jarringly, and intense thrillers I\\'ve seen in quite a while. It\\'s just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place! The first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation. Underling this is a humorously wicked black streak. Faults do pop up in the story, as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richard\\'s characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful. In the long run, it probably could have done without. Despite some cringe moments, this aspect didn\\'t hinder my enjoyment of it. For me, the soft ending they decided to go with just didn\\'t feel right.The interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods. So multi-facet was the context and its thrills, there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists. Really, they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation, by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke English and so we are caught up in the confusion too. The delicate Marina Zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the American mute girl Billy. The way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability. Director Anthony Waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish, well-timed and skillful manner, without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you. The only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by Alec Guinness. The performances by the cast were all fine, especially the nail biting turns by Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as the Russian murderers.This riveting feature that\\'s mostly made up of unknowns, is way better than your average dark thriller. Highly Recommended.\",pos\\r\\n\"This was an absolute disgrace! The worst dramatisation I have ever seen. German officer\\'s with a spotless English accent, they didn\\'t even attempt to be German.

This isn\\'t even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, whoever the guy\\'s name, was a complete jerk, and has a sick, perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his top-notch job, and lies through his teeth 24/7. The second I walk in to the room when my family are watching it (and believe me, they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief, perhaps even some fable in the end, sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good. No memorial was made.This movie has borderline insanity. It disrespects the elderly, the dead and women- and the director tries to make people to like it.I gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good. But not even that was all that memorable. If you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters, definitaly my friends- do not do this at home.\",neg\\r\\n\"i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all, no surprise it\\'s what crispin glover\\'s character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the killer\\'s girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual, rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life, and dead inside, that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this film when it came out. Let me see now--this guy who had earlier skied down Mount Fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act---to ski down the world\\'s highest peak. Well--AND HERE COMES THE SPOILER--what happens, see, after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top--and a life is lost in the bargain--he gets on his skis, manages to make it down a very very short way, at which point his PARACHUTE OPENS...and that\\'s that. And instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes ahead and releases it. SPOILER ENDS I do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got. ANOTHER SPOILER--Oh yes, one of the Sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse. The narrator, who is quoting the \"\"daredevil skier, casually remarks that, according to the Sherpa religion, since this man\\'s body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest. Is it worth it, the narrator muses. YES he answers--because it served the purpose of letting this clown \"\"ski down Everest.\"\" I can\\'t remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid. This is one to miss at all costs.\",neg\\r\\n\"There\\'s potential in there with \"\"Tell No-one\"\". A curious and intriguing plot, and a French take on a very American story. But for me, the opportunities were not exercised here.Although I liked aspects of this film, there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of ten.Firstly, it\\'s a silly, clich\\xc3\\xa9d murder mystery. A particularly contrived Murder She Wrote or Bergerac. Being French doesn\\'t eliminate this problem - it\\'s just silly and in French at the same time. It\\'s full of implausible coincidences.Secondly, the transition from the US to France seems to have failed chronically. This French doctor hanging out on \"\"the streets\"\" of a French city with his new \"\"homies\"\" and their blingin\\' SUVs... and then there\\'s the car chases...But thirdly and mostly, it\\'s just too darn long. To me, a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes, and over two hours takes some serious justification. This once didn\\'t have it.\",neg\\r\\nI would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old. Who can forget some of the best lines in film history? --- JOHNNY\\'S FAT BOY BURGERS!! JOHNNY\\'S FAT BOY BURGERS!! and LOOK BETWEEN THE GIANT MELONS! I used to wish I could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this. It\\'s an all-time fave and I\\'m happy to hear that it\\'s out on video! I\\'m positive that this is where MTV got its original premise for the Road Rules series.,pos\\r\\n\"This series is formulaic and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, Walker goes after him, and it ends in a Karate match. The villains are super-clich\\xc3\\xa9 super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. Certainly not Norris\\'s best work. His other work may be clich\\xc3\\xa9 but it usually does not drag on for weeks. If you enjoy formulaic,boring, repetitive clich\\xc3\\xa9d snooze-fests, then this is for you.\",neg\\r\\n\"To begin with, I have to admit I\\'ve never been a big fan of the Dutch movie-genre. Unfortunately watching De Dominee hasn\\'t made me change my mind. It shares some common flaws, like having a plot that\\'s too predictable and linear for my taste. Worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage-actors in a play. Unfortunately this is common too in many Dutch movies and, at least to me, makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters.The actor that plays Adri (I\\'m sorry, I forgot his name at the moment) is at least delivering a decent performance, and is one of the reasons I don\\'t rate this movie even worse.Another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget, and the production seems professional. Ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you don\\'t speak Dutch,although I already warned you that the plot isn\\'t spectacular either, but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch.\",neg\\r\\n\"I thought the movie was great. I thought Kristine DeBell was GREAT and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles. I even overlook the fact that the print I have wasn\\'t quite put back together correctly. But, who cares?\",pos\\r\\n\"\"\"Talk Radio\"\" is my favorite Oliver Stone movie, though he has made many great ones including \"\"Salvador\"\", \"\"JFK\"\", \"\"Natural Born Killers\"\" and \"\"Platoon\"\". But I like the intimacy of \"\"Talk Radio\"\", a cinematic expansion of Eric Bogosian\\'s searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a Dallas talk show host. Working with ace cinematographer Robert Richardson, Stone turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. Bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse Barry Champlain and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. Alec Baldwin, as his Alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry\\'s sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. John C. McGinley, as Barry\\'s long-suffering screener/technical producer Stu, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. The Stewart Copeland score is brilliant, too.\",pos\\r\\n\"This film should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor but even he couldn\\'t rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister\\'s death. Spoiler warning : In effect the truth is that the older sister ( played by Diaz) is just a spoilt, selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs. Not much of a twist and not that interesting either. The film is also overladen with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing. All in all this is definitely worth missing - not to be recommended.\",neg\\r\\n\"As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, too, I cannot see the movie as a movie, only. As a movie is has some great, wonderful shots of the ship, most of them done on an existing vessel - apart of the ones in the disaster scenes, of course, and a certain room under deck. But regarding the story and dialogs I only can call it big crap. Nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel. No wonder, the film had bad impact on the existing ship - if I didn\\'t know better, I wasn\\'t tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure. Definitely, for Europeans I recommend to switch off once the ship ran aground. After that, the over-emotional, very American part begins which I couldn\\'t bear. The pics are really, really great, no wonder in a Ridley Scott film, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will become much better.\",neg\\r\\n\"I\\'m not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci\\'s films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining \"\"Zombi\"\" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn\\'t really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why \"\"Don\\'t Torture a Duckling\"\" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery. Its possibly the best giallo ever made, only seriously rivaled by Dario Argento\\'s entries into the genre. And unlike Fulci\\'s previous giallo \"\"A Lizard in a Woman\\'s Skin\"\", this never drags.Fulci\\'s direction here is quite good. He keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer\\'s interest throughout. Also, the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience. Plus, he adds some clever touches, such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence. Overall, the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story. The acting is good for the most part also, full of familiar faces from 70s Italian exploitation cinema. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool throughout. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is just far too over-the-top. Its the only laughable aspect of the film. \"\"Don\\'t Torture a Duckling\"\" definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole.

It also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterix animation, which makes the largely entertaining story a lot more breathtaking to behold.Every scene of this movie is vividly rendered in bright cheerful hues adhering closely to the color schemes of the comic books it was based on. The character designs also stick relatively close to the comic, for better or for worse, preserving the simple but unique look of the characters. Being simple in terms of character design, this allows for more time and effort to be spent on the actual animation, which by the way surpasses many other big screen theatrical animated movies. Character movements are very fluid and possess a quality that looks way beyond what a modest budget would usually produce; there is always something moving in every scene and no evidence of the usual cost cutting animation short cuts. 3D computer images are incorporated seamlessly with the traditionally animated 2D art. If anything, the style of shading makes the 3D elements look more like traditional comic book paintings than CGI models.The storyline takes much of its elements from the \"\"Asterix and the Normans\"\" comic, and this is where its main flaw lies. As an adaptation of said comic, \"\"Asterix and the Vikings\"\" takes way too many liberties with its source material. Long time fans of the comic would no doubt find much to dislike about the movie\\'s story and its lack of adherence to the source.On the other hand, one can see this story as a really fun one if taken on its own without comparing it its source material. Highly comedic, well written jokes pepper the upbeat script. The funniest parts were the numerous pop culture references and jibes at modern day 21 century life. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are spoofed to great effect. Excellent chemistry and acting by the cast (I watched this in English by the way) though a couple of voices like Cacofonix I found really irritating (but I guess it is all part of his character).If there is anything to criticize about the story, it is the lack of \"\"asterix\"\". This story seems to be more like Justforkix\\'s story of teenage romance and \"\"coming of age\"\" with Asterix and Obelix merely playing supporting roles. This gives a pretty big sense of staleness since much of the story\\'s elements are the usual staples of such teen movies. Derivative and clich\\xc3\\xa9d at times, only the witty comedy and traditional \"\"Astrix\"\" elements (the Romans, the pirates etc) manage to save this film from falling into plain mediocrity.While not the best installment in the Asterix animated movie library, it is certainly one of the funniest, the best scripted and the most beautifully animated. DVD seems a little hard to come by though\\xc2\\x85\\xc2\\x85\\xc2\\x85\\xc2\\x85\",pos\\r\\n\"I watched this series on PBS back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so. Very atmospheric and creepy sometimes. This is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and acted. You are drawn into the plot and come to care for these people. The villains are almost laughably evil, especially the Sheriff of Nottingham. Man, I would love to beat the s--t out of that snotty little bastard. Nicholas Grace does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the Sheriff. His whipping boy, Sir Guy, is equally hissable but is also pathetic. Lots of murder and mayhem in this series, along with tons of black magic and Devil worship and things of that nature. I noticed it got an award for children\\'s television which is surprising. If I had kids, I would not let them watch this. Outstanding use of locations in this show also. It is now on DVD, so go out and buy it.\",pos\\r\\n\"First, the obvious\\xc2\\x97as a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama, QUAY \\xc2\\x85 is disconcerting ,straightly independent and a menace to banality. Jouvet\\'s aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force; his Antoine is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct. QUAY \\xc2\\x85 is not subversive in the sense that today\\'s (and already yesterday\\'s ) philistines enjoy using the word. It is Clouzot\\'s most playful hour. He tended to adapt Steeman\\'s books in a satiric note. (It\\'s said that Clouzot was a big reader of detective novels.) As a director, Clouzot\\'s firm hand is successful. It is not a mystery or a thriller,but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and at the police\\'s proceedings. Those accustomed with Clouzot\\'s masterpiece LES DIABOLIQUES might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things, styles, elements in QUAY \\xc2\\x85.Here Clouzot speaks about many things, about a couple, and a hidden love story (Simone Renant\\'s for Blier),about the entertainment\\'s world and about old spinsters, about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise, etc.. There is a note of exuberance\\xc2\\x97not only in Jouvet\\'s performance, but also in the film\\'s conception. Quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire. It offers an outstanding performance by Jouvet as a tough police inspector. Antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa ,but did not climb the ranks\\' stair because of his independent behaviors); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; at work, Antoine is tough and merciless, an able inspector, bitter, intelligent and harsh. It is a role of great gusto, very picturesque. Jouvet composed his character of several defining traits\\xc2\\x97his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality, and that mocking air \\xc2\\x85.Antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible; when he interrogates Blier, Antoine makes mistakes ,and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real life\\xc2\\x97mixed with errors and lacunae and defects. Antoine\\'s talent is one that comes also from experience, from daily observation\\xc2\\x97it\\'s not the almost supernatural _divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectives.QUAY \\xc2\\x85 is multifaceted\\xc2\\x97it is a realistic crime drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. One can consider it among the first _filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the French police. Long ago Eastwood\\'s and Wayne\\'s harsh cops, there was Antoine. The title is interesting, suggesting that this is a movie about the police, not about a case or a mystery. As craftsmanship, Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (in the way that Welles was). QUAY \\xc2\\x85 is very true to Clouzot\\'s nature\\xc2\\x97a sardonic comic, sharp observations, much psychology, sharp, unsparing irony. The man was first\\xc2\\x97class when he filmed something\\xc2\\x97he knew what to shoot, what to choose\\xc2\\x97see the introductory scenes of this film, with Jenny Lamour\\'s great stage success. Each scene is memorably, _exemplarily shot. Clouzot\\'s technical, stylistic aptitudes were amazing. His style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely limpid, ingenious. Jouvet\\'s style was exuberant, powerful, vehement. (Some disliked it precisely for these features. As he had been a great stage actor, his movie style was deemed as too theatrical, etc..) His Antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role, by a composition. Jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomy\\xc2\\x97much like a menacing bird of prey\\xc2\\x97somewhat like Van Cleef\\xc2\\x97yet much subtler, nobler and more intelligent and distinguished. Jouvet had this predatory, ferocious air, and it is useful here, as he performs an old tough cop. One of QUAY \\xc2\\x85\\'s sides is that it is a Jouvet recital. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his play (I see that many, watching this flick, do not know it is a Jouvet movie\\xc2\\x97which is an astounding quality in itself). Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors that I admire the most; the first one was revealed to me by a Renoir drama (the famous one), while Jouvet by a Carn\\xc3\\xa9 comedy. I was charmed to see that Clouzot gave leading roles to both of them.To end, a word about Steeman; he wrote the novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel, as a Fresnay comedy). Steeman was an old school mystery writer, in the Wallace vein. He became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions. When I was 11 I have read one of his thrillers, and liked it much.\",pos\\r\\n\"Now I understand that this took two months to shoot. Really? I\\'m pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie sucked so bad I couldn\\'t even pay close attention. Just more proof that boob bearing women can\\'t always save you from horrible writing, acting and direction. Now I understand it was a no budget endeavor, but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you don\\'t understand. Oh, there are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still, there aren\\'t enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job.

Ow, BURN!!! - Captain J\",neg\\r\\n\"I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, I still don\\'t see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans,and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the Medieval times. Lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion. I do not justify their actions but western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some. But still do remember the majority of the Islamic people are PEACEFUL! People of any nation feel some sort of patriotism but to start a war on the fact that I\\'m right and your wrong needs to be rethought. Again I repeat you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them.\",neg\\r\\n\"I posted on IMDb on this series recently, giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release.

Not waste as in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in a waste of opportunities.When I see this movie, I think of all the Star Trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story Shatner chose. The setup was like an average television episode, while the finish felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie.Nimoy, in directing II-IV, focused on the character of Spock--how he faced the Kobayashi Maru outside of the classroom, and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he didn\\'t. We don\\'t know much about Kirk that we didn\\'t know before. Again, one of the novels would have been better--try \"\"My Enemy, My Ally\"\" for a very interesting character study of our friend James T. The minor characters are used mostly for cute bits, and the Scotty-Uhura subplot seems way out of left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was Sulu-Uhura.Even hardcore fans can\\'t find much to enjoy here. Sorry, but it\\'s true.\",neg\\r\\n\"Although little more than a pleasant 11-minute musical diversion (it\\'s rightly billed as a \"\"Tabloid Musical\"\") EVERY Sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in cinematic history, since it provides an invaluable look at the burgeoning talents of two of the screen\\'s most talented and beloved musical performers: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.Although often cited as an screen test of sorts, produced by MGM to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractees Durbin and Garland whose options were reportedly coming up for renewal, this assertion is not entirely accurate. By the time EVERY Sunday was produced in July, 1936, Deanna Durbin\\'s contract with MGM had already lapsed and she had been immediately signed by Universal a month earlier, in June 1936.However, a provision in Durbin\\'s MGM contract permitted the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days, providing she had not yet begun work on a picture at her new studio. As Durbin\\'s debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, was still not ready to begin filming, MGM chose to exercise its\\' option and, although officially under contract to Universal at the time, Durbin found herself back on the MGM lot filming this agreeable short subject with fellow adolescent singing hopeful, Judy Garland.This, along with Garland\\'s far more extensive prior professional performing experience/training (which included appearances in several earlier movie shorts), may explain why EVERY Sunday often seems to favor Judy Garland over Deanna Durbin, giving Garland more lines to speak and an original song (\"\"Americana\"\") to sing, while Durbin offers the popular classical art song, \"\"Il Bacio\"\" by Luigi Ardiiti. Certainly, it would make perfect sense that MGM would want to favor one of its\\' own contract players over another from a rival studio.Ironically, although Garland\\'s character is the more overtly pro-active one of the two girls in this short, it would be Durbin\\'s feisty and impulsive \"\"Little Miss Fixit\"\" screen persona at Universal which would propel her to instantaneous worldwide super stardom as the world\\'s first \"\"Teen Idol\"\" with her debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland\\'s more passive \"\"wistful wallflower\"\" adolescent image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) the up-and-coming Lana Turner. Not until her fifteenth MGM feature, 1942\\' FOR ME AND MY GAL (which was also her first fully \"\"adult\"\" role) would Garland achieve the solo above-the title billing and \"\"solo attraction\"\" status of a true superstar that Durbin had attained instantaneously six years earlier.It is entirely inaccurate, therefore, to assert that Garland was the only \"\"superstar\"\" attraction of the two girls, as Durbin attained this status with press \\'n public, almost a decade before her MGM rival. Literally in foreclosure at the time of her signing, the on screen evidence strongly suggests that Universal was much quicker to realize Deanna\\'s full superstar potential than MGM was with Judy, and it\\'s worth noting that almost every notable accomplishment Garland achieved at MGM, from superstar billing, to having starring vehicles specially written to showcase her talents and appeal, to being invited to plant her footprints in the forecourt of Graumann\\'s Chinese Theater, to receiving an \"\"Honorary\"\" Oscar\"\" in recognition for her talent, Deanna Durbin received well before her gifted MGM contemporary.In any case, EVERY Sunday is a delightful, utterly unpretentious musical short. Its plot line (Durbin and Garland use their singing talents to save Durbin\\'s grandfather from being forcibly retired by the town council from conducting his Sunday concerts in the park), presages the plot lines of both Garland\\'s \"\"Let\\'s Put On a Show\"\" musicals with Mickey Rooney and Durbin\\'s 100 MEN AND A GIRL. Unlike Garland\\'s later BABES films, the short never treats the insubstantial storyline seriously, and consequently, its\\' eleven minute running time flies by.Of course, the true magic of EVERY Sunday is in observing the already remarkable performing talents/screen presences of Durbin and Garland at the very beginning of their legendary careers. Both girls, even at this early stage, possessed remarkable screen presences and are utterly natural and unaffected in their presentation as both singers and actresses. Garland fairly explodes off the screen with vitality as she literally punches out the lyrics to the jaunty \"\"Americana.\"\" As she socks across the number with appropriate hand gestures, Judy literally seems to be chewing on the words of the song as she screws up her mouth and bugs out her eyes in her intense eagerness to show what she can do.By contrast, Durbin\\'s presentation of \"\"Il Bacio,\"\" is far more demure and subdued. Although entirely appropriate for her \"\"classical\"\" selection, Durbin\\'s delivery of Arditi\\'s waltz is much more of the traditional \"\"stand \\'n sing\"\" variety than Garland\\'s physically emotive turn. Nevertheless, though \"\"miniature diva\"\" Deanna does nothing to call attention to herself, with her candid eyes, dazzling smile and artless delivery, she easily holds the screen with \"\"jazz baby\"\" Judy, and their delightful duetting of \"\"Americana\"\" in the short\\'s finale makes one regret all the more that producer Joe Pasternak was never able to realize his dream of pairing Durbin and Garland in a musical feature film (because Universal refused to loan \"\"Number One Asset\"\" Durbin out).A priceless document of the nascent talents of two remarkable and utterly unique talents. See this one if you get a chance!\",pos\\r\\n\"Where do I start? The plot of the movie, which is about a love between two high school students during wartime, while one is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi which was also turned into an anime in 2002, both of which I have yet to read or see.This review is about this live action adaptation however. Sadly, this honest to goodness was a terrible movie. It isn\\'t as if one could site certain aspects, and say, for instance, the budget is at fault, or the acting is to blame. It is, sadly, a series of underwhelming and ineffectual elements that bring this film down.The acting is poor. Not to say Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn\\'t have much to work with, and seemed miscast. Neither seemed to have the physical range to draw the viewer in the story as well as being too old for their parts to a distracting degree.The script was weak, the leads act unrealistically, and behave irrationally. The film also plays for the heartstrings, but ends up being predictable, all the while not being compelling, and under-developing the characters. There are also pacing issues.Visually, it is unremarkable. The film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes. The other special effects also have a cheap look to them, especially where minimalistic practical special effects could have been used. There is also no visual flair, as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating.The music and sound effects were fine, but unremarkable.Overall, the movie isn\\'t devoid of enjoyment, and fans of the series shouldn\\'t be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completion. People unfamiliar with Saikano, this probably isn\\'t the place to jump in as it isn\\'t a very good movie or melodrama. It isn\\'t the movie or the cast and crews fault, it just isn\\'t inspired, and that is what kills it.\",neg\\r\\n\"My first Mamin film, saw it on IFC long ago, and LOVED it. It seemed absolutely artistic, original, fun and hilarious. Not a moment in the film let me down or made me bored, and i was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face.

But here\\'s the catch: it\\'s also very artistic and creative - if you don\\'t know Yuri Mamin (probably, sadly, because so many of his GREAT films aren\\'t available here) he has a very original style like no one else\\'s, and for me this isn\\'t even my favorite film of his (right now it\\'s the insane (\"\"Saideburns/Bakenbardy\"\"). Also, i have to say as a Russian, this film is great because you really do see what Russians are like. And this is possible because this is a true Russian film to me, NOT a foreign film trying to be American or trying to appeal; Mamin did not sell out (nor has he since, Gorko (1998) was as good if not better. This is true Russian style filmaking that came out of communist Social realism.If you liked this film, i think you have a very high chance of loving Mamin\\'s other films, in fact i like quite a few of them more than this one. I guess this one is his most accessible film. A similar film is Fountain, taking place 6 years before during perestroika, it has the same actor in the leading role, and more of Mamin\\'s regulars who you will recognize from Window to Paris; this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy, a great one. Viva Mamin, hopefully Criterion will hook all of his movies up one day, he\\'s still working, and his catalog is so great! See any of his films if you can.\",pos\\r\\n\"I usually like period films but this one just seemed to drag and drag.

I\\'m in my late 40s, and watched it with my son-in-law (early 20s) and son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We watched about an hour of it and turned it off. I spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than I spent actually watching the movie. I gave it a 3 because I enjoyed the scenery and cinematography; otherwise I would have given it a 1. I\\'m sure there are people who are really into the \"\"art\"\" of it all who will find my review appalling but we\\'re all entitled to our own opinions, right? I couldn\\'t figure out if this was supposed to be a \"\"chick flick\"\" where the focus was on the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys, with the focus on battle and adventure. In my opinion, it didn\\'t succeed in either.\",neg\\r\\n\"It was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar had to be made and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood\\'s answer. Initially I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditionally Hollywood spice of Titanic-type love between the lead heroine and the Burmese male lead who happens to be an old man. Thankfully, nothing of that sort was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful.Anyway, the film was honest-to-God and I was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed. Apart from the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia & Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locales, I could not find much fault in the film.You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. It is after all, real events of a civil war. The music by Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it.I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie was made on my real-life experience which I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and needless to say, I could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening wonder for me.\",pos\\r\\n\"Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Not another Teen Movie and Another Gay Movie. Making \"\"Superhero Movie\"\" the eleventh in a series that single handily ruined the parody genre. Now I\\'ll admit it I have a soft spot for classics such as Airplane and The Naked Gun but you know you\\'ve milked a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off. In fact the only thing that might really temp you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell-out Leslie Neilson.You can tell he needs the money, wither that or he intends to go down with the ship like a good Capitan would. In no way is he bringing down this genre but hell he\\'s not helping it. But if I feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor Drake Bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment. The people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of laughless bile no funnier than herpes.After spoofing disaster films in Airplane!, police shows in The Naked Gun, and Hollywood horrors in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy lampooning everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns.Shortly after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly, high-school outcast Rick Riker (Drake Bell) begins to experience a startling transformation. Now Rick\\'s skin is as strong as steel, and he possesses the strength of ten men. Determined to use his newfound powers to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly -- a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law-abiding citizens.But every superhero needs a nemesis, and after Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry, he develops the power to leech the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous Hourglass. Intent on achieving immortality, the Hourglass attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble Dragonfly sets out to take down his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and directs this low-flying spoof.featuring Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor, and Regina Hall.Hell Superhero Movie may earn some merit in the fact that it\\'s a hell of a lot better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date. Laughless but a little less irritating than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the Spartans. But maybe that\\'s a good reason. There are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that was Meet the Spartans from our memory.My final verdict? Avoid, unless you\\'re one of thoses people who enjoy such car crash cinema. As bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2 but not quite as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super Villain.\",neg\\r\\n\"Yes, I watch this show. Because my girlfriend watches it, of course.

Then there\\'s Jay Manuel, A sober gay guy, very serious and amazingly professional, and Miss Jay, an extroverted one, \"\"queen\"\" of the catwalk and a damn funny guy, and Nigel, self-styled as the only man on the panel.Second, the show is an in-depth look at a shallow industry, and we\\'ve got to give it to the producers for showing us the inside view, which can be informative as well as entertaining.Finally, the edition is great; there is just the right mix of everything; The girls living together in the ego-house, their impressions on sets, the competitions themselves and the judging. All of this slides smoothly with just the right beat. There are no lenghts.Of course, there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we don\\'t see in the shows; The panel is made up of capricious divas, extroverted and quick on the bitching; woe to those who offends them! But that being said, as long as one contestant does not step on their toes, their judgment is usually fair - I think.So, give your brain a break; If you can\\'t beat them, join them, and have a good time watching this bit of reality TV with your loved ones. It will make crave for more, somehow.\",pos\\r\\n\"This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovsk\\xc3\\xbd is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details. Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who\\'s trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.Marcela (Anna Geislerov\\xc3\\xa1), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Lukn\\xc3\\xa1r) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There\\'s no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda\\'s garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.\"\"Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,\"\" begins the Graves poem. But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though Prague-born, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. He\\'s here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes\\' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn\\'t prevent Jarda from going off to jail.In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena\\'s present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn\\'t sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes\\'s whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. Clearly the \"\"good angel,\"\" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing. It\\'s only at the end, when he\\'s pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won\\'t lie down and be walked over. Also to be dealt with is Jarda\\'s religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film \\'Once,\\' including the latter\\'s theme song, \"\"Falling.\"\" They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from \\'Once\\'--though this film came first.Hrebejk\\'s people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. But such an elaborate demonstration wasn\\'t necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela\\'s conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. It\\'s fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves\\'s poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids. But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda\\'s annoyingly pious mother (Em\\xc3\\xadlia V\\xc3\\xa1s\\xc3\\xa1ryov\\xc3\\xa1). How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from \"\"India\"\" purported to be from his dad, who\\'s in prison? When did that come about? Interesting details, hastily pasted in. This seems a world in which you can\\'t see the forest for the trees.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks.

I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. It had excellent humor, nice stories and the show\\'s creators, Klasky & Csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies. The new show ALL GROWN UP tries to recapture the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found the \"\"all-grown-up\"\" Chuckie just annoying and the whole \"\"pre-teen-acting-mature/trying-to-be-popular\"\" that applied to (unfortunately) *all* of the characters dull and washed out. There still are some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole baby gang of RUGRATS look ten years from their age in the original show. Overall, this show is \\'fair\\' and only watchable if a) you\\'re a die-hard fan of the RUGRATS, b) have never seen the original show, c) you\\'re a pre-teen that has nothing to do, or d) your so bored that your somehow forced to see this show. This show is not that good. It doesn\\'t compare to the older RUGRATS episodes in quality, humor, and everything else.\",neg\\r\\n\"This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. It\\'s a short tragic film. Although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the \"\"what happens next\"\" factor. After watching it, I really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. I think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. The acting is amazing. There aren\\'t many lines in the film so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene. Both Franco and Miner have that element and it shows. For them (especially Franco) to take the time to make this, obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that, I appreciated the film for what it was. Also I\\'m happy I own it so I can share it with other people that would\\'ve never known it existed.\",pos\\r\\n\"...I can\\'t believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... This is such a slow POS going absolutely nowhere. Oh yeah OK it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Editing: BAD! I suppose the editor was told \"\"we need at least 90 minutes\"\", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. Music: don\\'t get me started on that, the lousiest score I\\'ve ever heard. Who is that singing in the last scene for crying out loud?? Directing: oh my, IMNSHO David Lynch sucks, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder. Skip this one.\",neg\\r\\n\"Ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink? Well, look no further!

(Not that anyone would find most of those funny to begin with.) It seems that when it just can\\'t get any worst, it pushes your expectations to an all new bottom, as it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. There was one scene that had me almost throw up and almost completely depressed at the same time. I don\\'t think I need to point out which one, but then again, I\\'m sure there are other scenes that will give people this same feeling.There was one moment at the end of the movie that actually made sense and was slightly realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled on with the nastiest remains of a trash bag and thrown several feet on the ground only to have a bunch of beer bottles smashed into his head. All of this probably when he least deserved it. So all thought of a 1 more point redemption was quickly regarded. This is indeed a terrible movie.

Theisen, who has made only one other movie, is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist, as are Sundquist as her strict father and Riise as a woman that Theisen is fascinated with. The film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired. Director and co-writer Nesheim, who has worked mostly in TV, is not up to the task.\",neg\\r\\n\"The Ghost Walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist, snappy dialog, and best of all a pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor Johnny Arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character. Mr. Arthur is great in his role of Homer Erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great character actor Richard Carle.They play off of each other superbly.Although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of Homer, it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration, and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer, who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee.There is a great scene where Homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.The mystery angle of the film is very entertaining, and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches.For a low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.Director Frank Strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through.This film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films, old dark house mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines \"\"It was a dark and stormy night)and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end.This movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the Internet Archive at archive.org.\",pos\\r\\n\"17/02/09 \"\"More\"\" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder For a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, I\\'m impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. I\\'ve only scoured the web quite briefly and I\\'ve already been informed that \"\"More\"\" is: a 19th Century-style romance, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to Pink Floyd completists. It\\'s fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder\\'s 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that \"\"More\"\" is anything but a pretty average film.Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached \"\"More\"\" as I did \"\"Easy Rider\"\" and Antonioni\\'s \"\"Blowup\"\" - as a \\'time-capsule\\' film, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. They all have similar flaws - either vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way - they are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. Thankfully, \"\"More\"\" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it.Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of French hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and self-conscious parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into play - she is the Sun, he is pursuing her. You may now be able to guess how this all ends.Ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the over-populated Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. Up until now I had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. During just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, I went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. I can\\'t think of many other films that have done this.The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from life-defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. They take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on Ibiza.Pink Floyd\\'s score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of \"\"More\"\". It is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around Estelle\\'s bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the soundtrack album\\'s front cover). A scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple - they cannot \\'land\\' without a crash. Maybe they\\'ve come too close to what they wanted.Stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in Paris. We are left to presume they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s Counterculture movies dwell on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, Schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man, who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears.\",pos\\r\\n\"And nothing wrong in that!

There is a reason for this utter lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. See this film for examples of terrible production in all respects. The opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. The ending features Michael McKean staring out a prison window saying \"\"There\\'s lots of mysteries out there.\"\" followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in between is awful. I struggled to find any value in this movie and have come up empty. Though it is hard to believe, even a cameo role from Burgess Meridith (always a crowd pleaser) only disappointed me further. This movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies. On paper the movie is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable. The movie attempts to branch off in many directions but never follows through on any. The unappealing conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved. No conflict is ever resolved. There really is no conflict. The women attempt to become hookers, but that never happens. Instead they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf stocker. Sound exciting? IT wasn\\'t. IT was stupid. And the bulk of the movie is the two women talking and generating contrived conflict. The women are capable actresses, but the script was beyond poor. Useless. This was a terrible movie, but it is even worst that they borough Burgess Meridith out of his retirement home to make it. Bad from start to finish.

I am not a Kiwi but I do know that the Haka can only be performed by someone of Maori origin and not by an all-American white boy.I am assuming that this was made for the American audience so the shallowness and \"\"Disney end\\'\"\" is excusable but there was hardly any attempt to point out the basic rules of the game apart from the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of an American Football game and gets everyone playing rugby instead. The only thing good about this film were the end credits. It would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into your eyeballs.\",neg\\r\\n\"The role of economics in the industrialized North American market must have always been theorized in the homelands of the engines creation. Persons and industrialist such as Mercedes Benz and the Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) surely realized the opportunity of the North Ameircan market with the purchase of fuel and number of automobiles purchased per household. This type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of Speed Racer.After the new constitution of Japan the industrialization of the isolated island nation of Japan must seek opportunity once again via economic partnerships with its global neighbors. This also helped spark the economic opportunities in the European and North American market if not the global market.Speed is a young avid driver who without knowing any better is driven by his demanding father Pops Racer who has challenged himself his whole life to make a better machine better at winning races. It was in fact Pops Racer who drove his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed. As a mature Racer, Rex, finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels obligated to his younger bother Speed.The exact relationship of Rex Racer to persons such as the Inspector are never really clear, but put into dramatization. Rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known Speed was in trouble. Or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity were his secretive knowledge is leveraged against an evil plot. This brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to Speed Racer.The mixture of Speeds innocence with Trixy, Sprital, and Chim Chim brings a level of comic human nature. This concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode. So, instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving, romance of cloak and dagger, and comedy of human nature is put into one story, Speed Racer.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie baffled me. I could not get a grip on it. Thought I might be missing something. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This isn\\'t always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinction).To expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time...so I will...They\\'re dressed like cowboys, but it\\'s modern times, right? No? I don\\'t get it??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL! That\\'s how it was presented. Haven\\'t seen that yet. Hope they did a good job.They DIDN\\'T! They tried to create an iconic character that would spawn a series. They didn\\'t.They tried to make an Aussie indie zombie flick on the caliber (and perhaps riding on the coat tails) of the very well done \"\"UNDEAD\"\". They didn\\'t.Okay, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing, disjointed, mess of film salad that might ultimately be edited into something watchable. They DIDN\\'T! This is the new number 2 on my list of Worst Zombie Movies Ever. There are really just the two so far, \"\"DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM\"\" being the first (not to be confused with \"\"DAY OF THE DEAD\"\", which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time). If you\\'re gonna make a zombie movie (and I\\'m not a zombie movie maker, I\\'m just a connoisseur) make a good one. Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of decent recent zombie filmaking. FYI.If you\\'re really forgiving, you might think, well, didn\\'t they at least throw in something to make us feel like we didn\\'t want our money back? Guess what...THEY DIDN\\'T!\",neg\\r\\n\"This film has some flaws, and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening. Possibly the greatest film to show the direness within Fly-Over Country, \"\"Rolling Kansas\"\" is a film in which nothing happens and you don\\'t care about anybody. Like life, it starts, it moves, and then it ends. A few attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance.Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie. This is free and repeatedly frequently on Comedy Central because nobody went to see it, nobody wants to see it, and it\\'s marginally better than dead air. Not to damn with faint praise, but the movie\\'s one rock song is worth listening to. Too bad the movie isn\\'t worth watching.\",neg\\r\\n\"\"\" I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be.\"\" Marlow in Joseph Conrad\\'s \"\"Heart of Darkness\"\"It\\'s difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art. Yet movies have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legislated. \"\"Chosen\"\" is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabar\\'s Sea Inside, based loosely on the true story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice clothed in love, poetry, and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor says farewell to lifelong friends and loves before he takes his life, then you are right. In fact, Sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes, a remarkable feat with not one of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting.Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and commanding voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of tough realist and poetic sufferer. Belen Rueda plays the disabled lawyer Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover for Ramon, increasing in radiance as her life degenerates with disease. Added to the already almost soap opera circumstance is Lola Duenas as Rosa, a blue collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade Ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romanticizing disability\\xc2\\x97This guy has unbelievable luck attracting substantial women, and he can\\'t move a finger. But talk he can, proving the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not just makes.I will refrain from mentioning the major motion picture now up for an Oscar that features euthanasia as its climax in order not to spoil the experience for first timers. Sufficient it is just to say both films are successful in opening up both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. The religious right has a right to complain that the former film and Barbarian Invasions celebrate suicide; it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced Sea Inside of the same.\"\"A life in this condition has no dignity,\"\" Ramon says. The irony is he conducts himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life. \"\"The Sea Inside\"\" is a formidable entry in 2004\\'s Oscar nominations for best foreign language film.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'ve watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now. When I came across it on DVD, I didn\\'t hesitate too long, even more, because I have a predilection for early Belmondo flicks. But what a bad surprise! Some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to preserve a certain memory, and not to shock audiences.Widely hailed as one of Chabrol\\'s rare cynic works, the only lasting impression I got from re- watching it is... boredom. Some movies really do not age in style. But what about movies which didn\\'t have any sense of style at all?The flaws in the script, uninspired acting - presumably due to the lack of direction -, a sort of production design, which doesn\\'t deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and, last but not least, the worst editing job I\\'ve seen in ages, make this one truly hard to stand.My impression was, that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously, no idea or any skills at all. It really comes as a surprise, that this one didn\\'t abruptly end Chabrol\\'s career. Don\\'t blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s, this one is crap in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.\",neg\\r\\n\"This woman is a terrible comedian. She can\\'t crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, \"\"well, it\\'s a comedy show,\"\" so I\\'ll laugh, I guess.I cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. She does not deserve anything but booing.Why can\\'t America dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.She is not funny. Not at all. Why oh why does even ONE person like this idiot?\",neg\\r\\n\"taking into consideration the Chan films that would follow, this isn\\'t bad. Plenty of stereotypes beginning with the Black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that \"\"every Hindu in town\"\" by rounded-up. A parade of stereotypical characters enter the scene including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to move quickly around the city going from Sutton Pl. to the W. Village in a flash.The ending is silly. An obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nose dives. Ed Wood couldn\\'t have done it better. The final scene is absurd as the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to quiet the one person who knows his identity. Overall, it is worth watching.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is the worst film I\\'ve seen in a looooong time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago -- without the athleticisme. By that I mean a few striking, artsy, images appear randomly, without any sustaining framework. The fake sepia tinted film is really tacky. This device is almost never justified and certainly is not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: you can fool some of the people some of the time.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is classic 80\\'s humor. If you were a teen in the 80\\'s this was a summer hit to go see. It was a early look at those now super stars. This and Better off Dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy. Everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager. Even crazy family and friends like these characters. To be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun. The uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed a bill to the kids after dinner, the twin brothers who look nothing alike, and to meet hoopz was so much fun. This may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon.\",pos\\r\\n\"Beautiful coming of age romance about an English boy and French girl who run off, and grow up.I saw this movie as a teenager and loved it. I saw it again this year and loved again.\",pos\\r\\n\"The film disappointed me for many reasons: first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well-built but did only feature a marginal role. Then, the story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. The Middle-Eastern setting, man with family meets new girl overseas, karaoke bar, the camera movements and the imagery - all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation which had also credibility. This movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins even considered doing this film!? The female main actress is awful - did she play the precog in Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in Translation didn\\'t have to show excessive love scenes. R-Rated just for this? This movie isn\\'t even worth watching it from a videostore!\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie is everything a Tenacious D fans can hope for. Director Liam Lynch partnered with The \"\"D\"\" is a concoction of epic proportions. Of course you need to understand the humour and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it there wasn\\'t too many laughs from the audience but the reason is not a lack of humour or intelligent jokes. This movie seems to have been released on to an unsuspecting public that haven\\'t familiarised themselves with the musical duo. This movie does stay true to it\\'s roots. For the few of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show people have noticed from the trailer the JB and KG apartment scenes and of course the open Mic nights that each Tenacious D episode would start and finish with. The soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away....And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic Devil.This is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a hard time and a rocking musical.\",pos\\r\\n\"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It\\'s all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. \"\"Teach me how to be likable\"\", art dealer Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. Just as we hope the travesty is over, Leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. Like Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois\\'s treasured Greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. Leconte\\'s only asset is Julie Gayet in the part of Coste\\'s business partner Catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut.\",neg\\r\\n\"Yet another \"\"gay\"\" film ruined by asinine politics. Luigi\\'s final speech just about sent me running out of the theatre with its bumper-sticker epigrams. Read the comic book it was based on for a much more entertaining experience.\",neg\\r\\n\"I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn\\'t much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn\\'t know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me. The special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in God\\'s name is going on. I understand Mark HIcks had a extremely low budget, but come on. And it is sad, because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see. But sadly, watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone\\'s life. It is so utterly painful to sit through. I really can\\'t even explain the plot to you because I didn\\'t understand it at all and I have sadly seen this film two times! Apparently they used some type of puppets for the \"\"alien dinosaurs\"\" like they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are awful, I can\\'t stress it enough. And most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly. It takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they look like they are in the kkk. And some box with a blue light on it is the president. I know in the interview Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, I can see why this didn\\'t make it to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman\\'s introduction is as always hilarious. Overall, don\\'t waste your time but check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!\",neg\\r\\n\"Earth Final Conflict began like a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens, why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race. Soon this resistance group begin to discover the sinister plans of the Talons using the humans in they own problems to survive they own destruction. As I said before, the show began great, all was almost perfect, including characters like Da\\'an, the original Da\\'an was a big mystery because he seems to be a nice creature but at the same time he has his own evil plans manipulating some people in earth. Soon came Zo\\'or who wasn\\'t bad but... mark the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first big enemy of humans, the incarnation of evil, killing what could be something greater in Da\\'an. The first seasons ends in a great way with the dead of Boone and the second shows a new lead character (Liam) an hybrid being of human and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers. He replace Kilner character in a good way so another storylines make it better, including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus. But as I said lines before the evilness of Zo\\'or begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same Talons. With time the whole great storyline of the alien roots of Liam where almost totally erased the same with other things of the previous seasons. So when the final season began the original Earth Final conflict was just an almost forgotten dreams, all the magic was missing, just to let some vain intents to keep alive the show including the return of Kilner and Liam for a few episodes. The final episode was just the evidence of how bad was the show with so many bad changes (to think the writers of some episodes didn\\'t know anything about the first stories), it was one of the worst end I have ever seen in a TV show. A real shame because Earth Final Conflict began like something unique, fresh, the stories the cast, after watch so many show from USA, something from Canada from the mind of the creator of Star trek was wonderful but in the end all change to worse. I hope someday someone make a remake of this show, of course using nothing from season fourth and fifth (except the cast, everyone were perfect in his work). I still can dream in a better things.\",pos\\r\\n\"Jack Frost 2. THE worst \"\"horror film\"\" I have ever seen. Why? 1)The premise is WELL beyond ridiculous 2) The damn thing doesn\\'t even have legs to move on! 3) It escapes AFTER being completely submerged in Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Get this...It travels all the way across an ocean of SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film. 5) \"\"Killer Snowballs\"\". I have yet to be drunk enough to see \"\"Ginger Dead Man\"\" so as of the writing of this, Jack Frost 2 hold the distinction of being THE stupidest \"\"horror\"\" film ever.

Gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore. This movie is based on the real story of that fight.By the standards of the 1950\\'s it was shockingly explicit. Although low-budget, that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting. A very gritty film. Richard Kiley was marvelous as always, and John McIntire stolid.Why this good movie isn\\'t on video is a real puzzle!\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry, but this movie is just way to shallow for me. In it, Perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend Keitel trying to make it as an actress. First of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? Even after sitting through this, I still don\\'t know. Oh yeah, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her like a lovesick puppy. There\\'s no reason behind the love, it just kind of happens. There are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your heartstrings, but it rarely works. The only character you really do feel anything for or with is Keitel\\'s character, and that\\'s only because he does such a good job with it. Any other actor and the character would have been just like the others.The script is basically an uninspired rehashing about how hard it is to make it as an actor/actress. It\\'s been done and said before, the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street pimp. The ending is...well, I don\\'t want to spoil it. Let\\'s just say it feels unsatisfying. I\\'d be more upset if the story was any good to begin with. The directing is average with nothing truly wonderful, but nothing that is really painful to watch either. To reiterate the acting, the only one that does anything worth watching is Keitel. Though I could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear.Oh yeah, Eddie Bunker shows up. As random as that mention is, that\\'s how random it is in the film. And Tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds.\",neg\\r\\n\"I give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for Damon Wayans as the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby, it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and I felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character. Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person. He is PHENOMENAL in movies, but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though I loved it, I felt that the laugh was more important than plausibility.Jay Kyle I have loved her since House Party and have enjoyed her in School Daze and Martin, this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co-star in. I also feel that Jay and Michael were more like equals in the show but Jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it workedJr Just plain stupid, his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness, we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing, which drives me nuts!!!!!!!! Not to mention that most of the situations (in episodes I\\'ve seen) seems to center around himClair The attractive sister who dated a Christian, I found her boyfriend\\'s character to be more interesting than she was (she\\'d be better off sticking to movies, the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it\\'s not stereotypical enough)Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter. I think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and FranklinFranklin I LOVE this character and I think they derived it from Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry) which only lasted one season. They did a great job of casting for this little genius (the effort would have been made if Jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also)All in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it\\'s homage to the Cosby Show is well done, I love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that. I can\\'t wait to see the series finale\",neg\\r\\n\"While I score the movie a 7, I also should point out that it is both interesting historically (as it stars Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less well-known) and features pretty exciting action for its day.The plot is odd for a Western, in that all the trouble with the Indians begins for the weirdest reason I have ever seen! The Indians decide to have a giant dog banquet (no, they are not feeding dogs, but feeding ON dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, there are not pooches left! So, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby White settlement and this actually touches off an all-out war!!!! Not only is this silly, but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences. I don\\'t know if American Indians actually ate dog, but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups. All this over dogs! The movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments--such as when Ms. Marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby! Exciting stuff! But, STRANGE, too!\",pos\\r\\n\"This film is an embarrassment. Nothing works on any level. The direction, screenplay, acting , and editing work together to repel your eyes from the screen.

I don\\'t think I would get tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects.

I\\'m just surprised that I had never seen it before this past weekend. I think that it\\'s positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing. It would be nice to cuddle up with your \"\"honey\"\"; sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other. There is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don\\'t know where to turn. You will know exactly how the character feels. True family expression is available all the way through. In fact, at times you\\'ll even think you are part of that family or they a part of yours. See it!\",pos\\r\\n\"Both the book and the film are excellent in their own right. They do differ slightly but that enhances and not detracts from what is an excellent script and acting. The historical atmosphere, the young girl looking for love, the amazing background of music hall and the voyage into the lesbian world of London early twentieth century make this an exceptional movie. Andrew Davies as the scriptwriter excels himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both excellent actresses and give these parts their best. The rest of the cast are very good. If there was higher than 10 out of 10 I would give it!\",pos\\r\\n\"THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting made for HBO movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don\\'t know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world, but Letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood\\'s most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job. It\\'s not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two late night superstars, this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television. According to this movie, Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno and that\\'s where Helen Kushnick came in. The movie presents Leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of Helen\\'s strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC\\'s biggest power players and it presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who, despite having Carson\\'s support, was railroaded by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it is the razor-sharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling. Bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. There is also a wonderful turn by impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson, but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by Bates that make this one worth checking out.\",pos\\r\\n\"The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bather washed up on the shore, a forlorn Jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery. Yep,this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end. Jim does well to unravel what is, a priori, an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home. To be sure, the eventual explanation is a little far-fetched. Why, for example, go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her AND her companions out would\\'ve been as easy and left less of a trail. However, these niggles aside, it\\'s a memorable TRF episode full of invention, even if YET AGAIN Jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious Police Dept. I mean to say, have the ungrateful so-and-so\\'s ever sat down and counted just how many of THEIR files have been solved by dear ol\\' Jimbo?\",pos\\r\\n\"As talk-shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it\\'s a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it\\'s not too bad. Other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars. During the OJ Simpson trial, it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes, it comes off a little bit like trash television--Jerry Springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience.On the other side, King\\'s show is definitely much better than Bill O\\'Reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest-political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but alas, he is not a great one. King does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. Always seems like the minute King can\\'t quite deal with the issue at hand, that\\'s when he turns to the phone calls, maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has. He might interview someone like David Gergen, but may not have read any of his books. Sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script.When it\\'s an entertainment celebrity, no problem. He can come off like he\\'s thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. And I notice he usually has seen the star\\'s latest movie. Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. However, if it\\'s the likes of John Dean or Bob Woodward, King comes off a little like he didn\\'t quite finish his homework. So off to the phones.If you are looking for real in-depth interviewing, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and/or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. I don\\'t see King quite doing that. Granted, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross, which may say more about the American audience than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill but not as good as Terry.\",pos\\r\\n\"Although I\\'m not too much of a religious person, I still had relatively high hopes for this movie, as it does have the amazing Steve Carrell, and its prequel, Bruce Almighty, was actually a creative and clever Christian-themed comedy. However, Evan Almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has, and can\\'t decide whether it\\'s a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. If it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on, it could have lived up to its potential, but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity, but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience, and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie\\'s opaque message. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very poorly written, there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. For example, although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, is their inclusion really necessary when the only \"\"flood\"\" that happens in the movie is downtown Washington D.C. and a suburban neighborhood, meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out? The filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the Bible story whatsoever, and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot, leaving many elements that just don\\'t add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie. Overall, this work is tragic in that the acting talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes isn\\'t exhibited because of the bland characters they portray, and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film\\'s attempted themes, and makes a mockery of the first film. Finally, Evan Almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway-intelligent moviegoer, in that it fails both of them miserably.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and...

Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters. Several years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey-man and it\\'s a more natural, more wild and more down-to-earth Tarzan that he gives away here. Hudson skilfully avoids the clich\\xc3\\xa9s that you usually grant to Tarzan such as his famous scream or his friendly pet, Cheetah. Not only, are we far from the designed and invented character made by Hollwood but we are also far from the film set used to make his stories. The movie was partly made in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The movie introduces two obvious parts: the first one which takes place in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the apes and considers himself as their lord. But he ignores his real origins. The second one in England where Tarzan discovers the English society. Ian Holm epitomizes the link between the two parts and Hudson avoids all that could make the movie falls into the ridiculous thanks to a clever screenplay. Indeed, Holm teaches Lambert basic rules of manners so as to behave correctly in the English society and the result works. Moreover, in the second part, no-one ever laughs at Tarzan and he\\'s even really appreciated. As far as the end is concerned well it\\'s a both bitter and happy end. Happy because Tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his adoptive close relatives. But bitter too, because this homecoming means that the Greystoke line won\\'t be ensured and is condemned to disappear... Christophe Lambert finds here, his first (and last?) great role. Sadly, he\\'ll never equal the achievement of his performance in this movie and he\\'ll play in poor and insipide action movies. Nevertheless, as I said previously, a clever screenplay, a performance of a rare quality, some impressive natural sceneries (both the jungle and the English country and we get a gorgeous movie. It\\'s also an excellent rereading from a popular novel. So why is it only rated barely (6/10)?\",pos\\r\\n\"For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!

The premise is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals. But the director\\'s weak swats at symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark, and it leaves us, the audience, feeling confused & disordered. Bravo.Perhaps if this movie had been presented as a European \"\"American Pie\"\" flick, then I\\'d be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. But right off the bat, the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the \"\"inner self\"\" vs. the \"\"public self\"\" (one\\'s \"\"mother tongue\"\" vs. one\\'s \"\"secondary language\"\"). Furthermore, it dives boldly into the subject of racial/national stereotyping. Off to an interesting start, eh?WRONG. That\\'s as far as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director\\'s way of floundering to get back on topic. It reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere, but the speaker ends by saying, \"\"So in conclusion, I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!\"\"Furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking, beer-swilling English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whilst the Europeans tolerate him superciliously? Why is the British girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs (calling French people \"\"frogs\"\" and butchering the French language) while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this isn\\'t a deep or well-thought out film. It\\'s simply an Anglophobe\\'s retort to the Anglophiles. But really it\\'s no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there\\'s a funny irony to consider.OK, philosophy, artistry & socio-political commentary aside, I was still very bored by this movie. There is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls\\' boyfriends, but aside from that I was hardly entertained at all. The only reason why I watched it through to the end is that I\\'d like to brush up on my French & Spanish.

I haven\\'t actually seen the darn thing). I guess those who HAVE seen Christmas Carol and so used to his character might find The Bells of St. Trinians rather surprising. You see, in this movie, Sims has two roles. One, he plays a heavy better, and in the other, he\\'s in drag as a headmistress for a private girl\\'s school! So once you get that through your thick skull, this movie offers plenty of delights. The plot is deals with the way the school tries to make some desperately needed money through a horse race. It\\'s actually a little more complicated for the small kids to handle, but I think they would be preoccupied with their antics, and with the horses to really notice. The adults too might get tripped over all the thick accents being thrown around as well. But again, the story is reasonably light, the action crazy and frenetic, for one to really notice.

Surprise, she couldn\\'t remember. So I told her to see the movie. Arthur Miller, in not a screen play but a NOVEL for a change, was 30 when he wrote this in 1945. It is a painful depiction of anti-Semitism. Yet oddly enough, there is a tender story of human relationships (Finkelstein, the Jew, with Newman, the non-Jew, primarily) underlying the cruel story. The acting is competent and the cinematography is very good.The only reason I can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that it\\'s >>aaagh<< controversial.I actually give it ten of ten.

They certainly faked it pretty well though. Why\\'d they make a movie without any new aspects? This is just plain boring and it\\'d been done totally without any imagination.I thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie\\'d be something really original.

It has with a few exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery. They are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director (In this case they are the same person.) who clearly don\\'t know what they are doing, they have both a messiah wannabe that don\\'t really deliver, as a hero (Played in this case by a guy that looks like Mark Hamill but sadly the force is not with him.) and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess up the life for each other, they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some (often badly made) computer animation. The exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who don\\'t even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room, the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in tilted \"\"Battlefield Earth\"\" mode but for the most of the time are flat as a pancake, the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only contents a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert, that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to mimic \"\"The fifth element\"\"\\'s fashion madness with the addition of the silliest hats ever made. Silly moments to remember: 1. Every scene with the guild guys, who looks like MST3K\\'s observer guys but with silly hats. 2. Irulan shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (Why butterflys? -was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner?) with matching silly hat, together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats. 3. Paul the stand-up comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen in over acting overdrive, screaming \"\"I,m alive\"\". 5. Every Scene with the backdrop, because it newer fits the foreground 6. Every scene with the Fremen\\'s fake religious cermonies, specially the \"\"water of life\"\" cermony. 7. The battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again.

I\\'ve only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it!Overall, the movie is very entertaining, provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do I find boring! It was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. I was happy to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, they all delivered solid performances. I tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one, specially in the terms of the script.That could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. One thing that did bother me a bit was Jennifer Aniston\\'s performance. I thought she wasn\\'t the right person for this role,I just couldn\\'t see her as a rock star girlfriend.But as the movie goes on, you somehow realize that she did a good job with this.There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn\\'t live you cold.

But like BMWs and Mercedes when Germans get it right I really like their films. Like PQ the time here went so quickly, lots of laughs from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time.While many films are overlong this one I could have watched much more of. It had the sort of characters and character development for a series. Given time I will re-read AriesGemini100 review and reference the actors I liked and their other work with a view to keeping an eye out from them. I agree....most of these actors will go onto bigger and better things. Some very good character actors in this fine film. I did see it in the program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or otherwise it felt very real. And quite romantic in it\\'s way.Viva la Deutcsh!\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this at the London Film Festival last night, apparently the shorter version. James McNally\\'s summary of the content of the film is very good. Nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation, homogenisation, the effect of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity.The film is shot on hand-held DV which some might find offputting, but which does enable Nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment.Despite the sprawling feel of the film, the editing is very sharp, not only giving us a parade of the world\\'s dogs, but also undercutting a number of interviewees\\' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves. To a degree this evoked Michael Moore\\'s recent work (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls\\' \"\"The Sorrow and the Pity\"\", both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of \\'salt of the earth\\' French peasants as the stars. De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered questions afterwards. We do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo Hubert!Overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people, and organise our world.\",pos\\r\\n\"I will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best.\"\"This is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film Tarantino has ever done.\"\" \"\"The ONLY good thing in this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz\"\".\"\"So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened\"\" Now for more details go and read \"\"Hated it\"\" reviews.One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know Tarantino\\'s style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazis Officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied France and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings? Where also an American-African walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 \"\"heroes\"\" to slay Hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go watch Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myers impersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing Hitler, just picture that.What ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character, which nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with Nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds!!! Imagine that.My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2hrs 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break, go watch this movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"Okay, to be fair this movie did have an interesting concept. Given a few script rewrites, some decent actors and a budget, this might have been a fairly decent cult flick instead of the MST3K fodder it turned out to be.Still, it was better than \"\"Armageddon.\"\"\",neg\\r\\n\"I have never seen the first Killjoy film, and I have also never heard a good thing said about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. Starring Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon it boasts. Now being the massive Troma fan that I am there is no way I\\'m not going to rent this film out, how can it possibly be bad with these two init? Oh how wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is. Trent quite frankly stinks as Killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one-liners in the history of film. Debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn\\'t enough. The kills are terrible as are the gore effects. For example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other. And just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst I have ever seen in movie history. The film doesn\\'t even work on a so bad it\\'s good level. Avoid like the clap.2/10\",neg\\r\\n\"Okay, I\\'ll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. But the thing that most people don\\'t get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy. I mean, did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece? Just look at the \"\"scary\"\" hologram on the jacket of the movie and you\\'ll find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as funny), this movie turned out to be a side-splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue, bad one liners and horrible special effects. And it\\'s all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. It certainly worked for me.For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled husband): What makes you frown so heavily darling?If that chunk of dialogue doesn\\'t make you laugh, then you have serious issues. Who in their right mind would utter those words in real life? Of course, no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous! Just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you\\'ll see what\\'s so damn funny about Jack Frost 2.\",pos\\r\\n\"This low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods. The fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you wound up with a fake looking crocodile, bad C.G.I., or an obvious studio setting. Fortunately none of the above are involved with this terrific, very realistic film. The crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I., and the on location filming takes place in an actual Australian swamp. The actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeed. You can place yourself in their predicament, which is testament to how realistically \"\"Black Water\"\" translates as entertainment. Highly recommended. - MERK\",pos\\r\\n\"The two most noteworthy things about \"\"I Won\\'t Play\"\" are: It won an Academy Award as the best two-reel short film of 1944; and it was directed by silent-era leading man Crane Wilbur. The plot of this run-of-the-mill short is inconsequential, the dialogue lacks spark, while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most war-themed Hollywood movies of the 1940s (in other words, it\\'s awful). Admittedly, there are moments when \"\"I Won\\'t Play\"\" is funny -- Janis Paige\\'s totally artificial look and line delivery are precious -- but one laughs AT the picture, not with it.\",neg\\r\\n\"Wow this really is stereotypical, terrible trash. i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see this.i am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie, i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible movie.i will now be more wary when i watch late night movies.this is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence (though it could be), but i don\\'t think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life. it makes the Scary Movie series look intelligent.1/10 i\\'d give it a 0 if they would let me\",neg\\r\\n\"\"\"Dead Man Walking\"\" is a film not about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death penalty case -- the killer, the families whose kids were killed, the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor, and what happens. It tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (not often, it\\'s never an easy film to watch) I\\'m more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here. So revealing that it could be a documentary, so compelling you can\\'t take your eyes away, so subtle and yet so powerful... \"\"Dead Man Walking\"\" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It doesn\\'t matter whether you\\'re for or against the death penalty (or even have no opinion), this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure. It takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once, and everyone involved in the film pulls it off -- there isn\\'t a single scene that rings false. A masterful film, but don\\'t expect light viewing... to some, the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable, even though no blood or violence is shown. You get drawn into this film and become a participant, and there\\'s a character for just about everyone to identify with. 10/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a clich\\xc3\\xa9, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet.In sitting through this, I couldn\\'t help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan\\'s ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.\",neg\\r\\n\"I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. Both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with Dorian (this is not in the original book), and that is my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV-version is much better looking (I think) and far more ruthless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more true to the novel\\'s Dorian. In the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even hints at Dorian\\'s liaison\\'s with men, as does Wylde, which could not be done in the MGM version).\",pos\\r\\n\"The film version of \\'Rising Damp\\' came out two years after the television series ended. Like many fans I duly went along to the cinema when it opened. I came away bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not have spent very much time writing the script; most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes. At the time of the film\\'s release, the \\'Rising Damp\\' series was still being repeated regularly on I.T.V. so the public was being asked to pay to see something they\\'d seen already. At least the \\'On The Buses\\' movies boasted original screenplays.Secondly, Richard Beckinsale had died the year before, so they eliminated the character of \\'Alan\\' as a mark of respect, substituting art student \\'John\\', played by Christopher Strauli of \\'Only When I Laugh\\' fame. It simply wasn\\'t the same.As another poster has pointed out, Rigsby\\'s boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series, being bigger and altogether cleaner.Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original \\'Casino Royale\\', a film steeped in surreal humour. \\'Rising Damp\\' also has its share of \\'Walter Mitty\\' style fantasy sequences, such as the \\'Saturday Night Fever\\' parody. Personally, I found them horribly out of place. A case of \\'over-egging the pudding\\'.On the plus side, Leonard Rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the seedy \\'Rigsby\\', as are Frances De La Tour as \\'Ruth\\' and Don Warrington as \\'Philip. Its just a shame the film isn\\'t worthy of their talents.When Rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by I.T.V. as a tribute, with its final scene - showing Rigsby laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interests of good taste.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie is bad.

I woke up today still feeling depressed, and haven\\'t been able to shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed straight up lost in this thing, as was I. When Cedric the Entertainer is the high-water mark (a man so un-entertaining that he has to call himself \"\"the Entertainer\"\" so you\\'ll understand what it is he thinks he\\'s doing), you have a serious problem. Also, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is down-right creepy, since he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea how long they\\'ve been polishing this turd. This movie is mean to the bitter end. We stayed just to make sure they didn\\'t give Robert an \"\"In Remembrance\"\", which they didn\\'t. Save yourself! Save your money! Save your soul!\",neg\\r\\n\"This film is one of those that can\\'t be regarded by its outwardness. Indeed, at a first sight, it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money. But..let\\'s take a look on the other side...What do you see? You see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have:Should I do the right thing, or should\\'t I? And... what\\'s the \"\"right thing\"\"? Le\\'s make a deeper analyses... -What does it mean a little town in the border? - It means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn\\'t... - What does it mean the arid soil shown in this picture? - It means the dryness that sometimes take possession ot our offensed hearts... - What does it mean the phrase of the character (KRISTEN) :\"\"Now I belong to him\"\"? - It means the loss of our free will, due to our unpremeditated deeds. In MY OPINION that\\'s the writer of the story and the director tried to \"\"tell\"\" us. By the way...do you remember what another character (JACK BARNES)said:\"\"Nothing is so simple...\"\"\",pos\\r\\n\"One reviewer says of those who might not like this film that \"\"it will only be appreciated by film goers who weary of film as diversion\"\". This, I feel, is rather unfair to those of us who find it boring.I have not become weary or disillusioned with film or with film makers, but found this tedious and self indulgent. But then, it\\'s true, I\\'m not too big into deep meaningfulness. I feel that it may have great meaning for those in the know, you know.It is very slow and it spends a long time in trying to make its individual points, using imagery, indeed, to do so. But in such days as these, it seems possible that a film like this might be the kind of thing that you\\'d come across in one of those dark and daunting booths in modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular cinema setting.\",neg\\r\\n\"I personally found the film to be great. I had it on pre-order for a month and watched it twice the day I got it in the mail, and several time since.. Yes, the time lapses may be a bit much, but the rest of the movie clearly compensates for it. All amature cast, yet the acting was right on for each part. The plot itself is just... haggard!

An embittered, \"\"Spike\"\"-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings. The two leads are terrific, especially Robertson, who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to pull off this tricky role. He appears in almost every scene, and acts up an absolute storm. To anyone who doesn\\'t know, they might think he really has CB. Highly recommended.\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I\\'ve seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character \"\"Conrack\"\") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands\\' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home. The heart of the movie is Conrack finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. The students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that, only a short time before, had been foreign to them. Conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be, oh a little fun! God forbid. Learning AND fun? Together? Can\\'t be, or so says the ones in charge. To avoid a spoiler, I shall just say that Conrack finds resistance with the boss man....and the ending is truly bittersweet.I am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience, so I should identify with the lead character, Pat Conroy (aka, Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I don\\'t, I identify with the black kids. As a kid, I was bussed to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade, circa 1979. These kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then. Luckily, in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old, one doesn\\'t understand racism. I just remember we were all being kids, playing 4-square, kickball, hide-and-seek, and running relays.This movie is very moving. There are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end, non-stop. I found myself many times with tears in my eyes, then suddenly laughing out loud. It\\'s a funny movie.\"\"Git away from that winda!!\"\".... \"\"Sir, if you\\'re prepared to accept crap, I should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap.\"\"..... \"\"So, you the white schoolteacher, Mr. Conrack.

I intend to seek out more reviews, comments, background, and \"\"making of\"\" tidbits, if they are out there. What amazes me is the acting given from the untrained kids. One of the kids, Mary, I understand was an actress, and you can tell. However, the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions. I wonder how they did it! I\\'m guessing that Conrack and Mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or ad-libbed.Conrack is a special movie. In my opinion, it is one of the very few movies that are so good AND so unknown. Others in that category are King Rat (\\'65), Dark Passage (\\'47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy (\\'80), and Bad Day at Black Rock (\\'55). I recommend them all. But first, take a seat in the class of Mr. Conrack.\",pos\\r\\n\"The only reason to see this film is Sung Hi Lee, the stunning model/actress from Korea who plays \"\"Muka Laka Miki\"\" (give me a break) in this otherwise crappy movie. She is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well, though none of the parts is really interesting or well written. Even for a National Lampoon\\'s movie, it\\'s really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. I may have laughed once, and that was probably just me being polite.Warning: Watching this movie may be bad for your health on two counts: 1) It, like, totally sucks. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your brains out of the back of your head upon first sight.So don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you...\",neg\\r\\n\"In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood\\'s \"\"Rendition\"\" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood. It\\'s not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.The term \"\"rendition\"\" refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the United States. He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby on the way. He seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing about.On the negative side, \"\"Rendition\"\" falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman, a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwar\\'s \"\"interrogation\"\" at the hands of Egyptian officials. The problem is that, as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too much of a na\\xc3\\xafve \"\"boy scout\"\" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn\\'t given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character. We know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. He \"\"goes through the motions,\"\" but we learn precious little about the man within. Thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions. A similar problem occurs with Anwar\\'s distraught wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.What makes \"\"Rendition\"\" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie\\'s closing stretches. It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is Hollywood after all, and the film has to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project.Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film: Omar Metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and Yigal Naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebe.Does the movie oversimplify the issues? Probably. Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces? Most definitely. (One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist). Yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground. It isn\\'t afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes. It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of \"\"civil liberties for all\"\" in the face of terrorism and fear. And just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say \"\"enough is enough,\"\" even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? (The movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism).Thus, to reject \"\"Rendition\"\" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. \"\"Rendition\"\" may not be perfect, but it IS good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live. And that alone makes it very much worth seeing.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie just was not very funny.

If you have any love of flying at all, especially an attachment to the planes of WWII, this is an absolute must see, vastly superior to the pathetic \"\"Pearl Harbor\"\" and up there in rivalry with the famed \"\"Battle of Britain\"\" filmed more than thirty years ago. There are moments when you feel as if you are flying wingman, literally dodging the shell casings of your leader as you roll in on a Me 109 or He 111. As an historian this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by tens of thousands of gallant Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who in 1939-1940 fled their homelands, made it to England, fought with utmost bravery for the survival of western civilization, and then were so callously abandoned by \"\"us\"\" after the war when they were arrested by the communists upon their return to their native lands. I have stood atop Monte Cassino in Italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the Polish troops that stormed that mountain that British and Americans could not take. I have traveled as well to Prague (the most beautiful of cities) and studied their history. Their story of abandonment, I believe, should be a lesson to us even today about obligations to gallant allies. But back to the film. If you love flying, see this. If you are interested in the aircraft of WWII most definitely see it. Without doubt the most brutal, direct, and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film.

We have some thieves pulling a jewel heist and when one does something wrong the alarm is triggered and the cops chase them and when the car turns around at a road block one of the thieves (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whoever he is here) gets shot. Now, it seems like he might die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad-scientist friend (and wife) he is saved, with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called \"\"The Sadist\"\". The Sadist is unfortunate in that the gentlemen that kidnapped him lost their knife to remove is head, so to add insult to injury (or, in this case, death), they remove his head using a train, leaving the body for the authorities to find, oops. Once the brain transplant is complete Naschy wants to ravage any woman that comes near him, because he now has the mindset of his donor. Well, of course this is all pretty improbable and features medical equipment that looks to have been purchased at Radio Shack, and overall it\\'s pretty cheesy and sleazy. But, it has a good early 70\\'s look and feel to it and the music is cool. This isn\\'t so much a horror movie but more a thriller with lots of thugs battling it out over turf and babes and other thug-type things, but it\\'s strangely entertaining in ways I can\\'t begin to describe. 7 out of 10.\",pos\\r\\n\"A very great movie.A big love story. Lots of sword fighting. Huge battle scenes. Heros and villains. Real history.Few in the West know much Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The country is in fact named after him. Some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed. This is a historical epic of how he ended the Period of Contending States and unified China. He founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that permanently defined Chinese civilization ever since.Chin (or the King of Zheng as he was known before he founded the empire)was roughly contemporaneous with Scipio, Hannibal, and Fabius in the West. The parallel Roman world dominance (West and East worlds) was achieved without a single towering personality like Chin. It would not be for another century before the West produced Caesar - the nearest comparable Western figure.Chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot. History only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film. The famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be. Gong Li is lovely. She is the emotional core of the story.

Somehow however, this film got by me until I had a chance to catch it today courtesy of my local library. I was struck by a number of elements during the story, as right from the start, you have a new Lone Ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening used on the TV show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a nicely expanded role, even though he takes his share of lumps throughout, getting beat up and shot more than once. Perhaps most interesting of all, the Ranger actually shoots to kill in a couple of situations, putting his character at odds with the vision created for the TV series that he would never use his weapon to kill, only to wound or to protect himself and others. Aside from that, you have a fairly traditional Western adventure. The Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe whose members are being murdered by hooded raiders attempting to track down five medallions that together, form the key to a fabulous treasure. Interestingly, the leader of the bad guys is an already wealthy woman, disarmingly portrayed by Noreen Nash. Her top henchman is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the baddies. Bradford\\'s character was one of the men shot by the Lone Ranger, which got me to thinking how many times that might have happened in the TV series. A quick check revealed that he appeared in \\'The Lone Ranger\\' show fifteen times, while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. What might be most interesting of all about the picture is it\\'s attempt to portray Indians in a revisionist light at a time when TV and movie Westerns were still largely portraying the red man as an illiterate savage. The character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most revealing in that regard; he\\'s an Indian who attained an education and went on to become a doctor, returning to the land of his tribe to tend to the needs of all it\\'s citizens. For purposes of the story, he had to impersonate a white man to be accepted by the local ranchers. This was the hardest thing for me to accept about the story line actually, as Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of the elderly Chief Tomache (John Miljan). That no one in the story except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew that he was really an Indian was something of a stretch for me. I suppose it was possible that he left the tribe at an early age, but without that back story fleshed out, it didn\\'t make sense to me that no one else from the tribe would know who he was.I don\\'t know why I\\'m intrigued by this so much, but after watching and reviewing over two hundred Westerns on this site, I\\'ve suddenly come across three films in the past month that utilize a blanket pull gimmick like the one performed by Tonto\\'s horse Scout in this picture. Roy Rogers\\' Trigger did a similar stunt in 1952\\'s \"\"Son of Paleface\"\", and I caught it again in 1958\\'s \"\"The Big Country\"\" by a horse named Old Thunder in that flick. It\\'s done as a bit of comic relief in a situation that wouldn\\'t normally come up for a horse, and it now makes me curious when the bit might have been first done. I\\'ll have to keep watching more old time Westerns. Not to be outdone, Silver had a chance to shine in the picture as well, making the save of an Indian baby that was about to be used as a hostage by bad guy Brady.Speaking of gimmicks, Clayton Moore borrowed a tactic from the TV series when he donned a disguise as a Southern gentleman to smoke out the villains posing as the hooded raiders. Whenever he would do so in the half hour format, it was always clever enough to hide his real features, usually with a beard as done here. One of the more interesting episodes I recall had to do with the Ranger impersonating an actor in the guise of Abraham Lincoln.Keep an eye out for a couple of goofs I spotted along the way. In an early scene at the opening, an Indian is shot by one of the hooded raiders, and in a close up, there\\'s blood on his shirt but no bullet hole. Later on in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson ride up on the Indians after they\\'ve kidnapped one of the villains out of jail. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the raiders, but is immediately shown about to make his getaway on horseback with Wilson.\",pos\\r\\n\"Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard\\'s Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared.

But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter.

Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 3:10 to Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up, and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys, some good, some not so good.It also means we get tight, realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough, slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It is not as intense, bloody or gory as those two, but it is almost as good. If you like those two, including David Croneberg\\'s equally wonderful Eastern Promises, you will like Killshot also.Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable, if not successful: Proof, Captain Corelli\\'s Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love.Diana Lane hasn\\'t had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs, and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark, balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension.This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane, including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut.While you are in the crime drama section, also pick up Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, and Gone Baby Gone, and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead. The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney.Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck. It is certainly worth a 3-4 dollar rental, if you like this genre. 6/20/2009\",neg\\r\\n\"Before I had seen this film, I had heard some negative comments about it. However, when watching it I found myself thinking \"\"ok, it\\'s a little slow-paced but this is quite interesting\"\". As it built toward the end, it created a complex moral dilemma, leading to a shocking yet, within the context of the film, entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed through, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the film.However, due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally, tacking on an unnecessary happy-ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should end her life but inexplicably doesn\\'t. Incidentally, please tell me if I did miss something here and there is a reason why she survives as I just couldn\\'t how logically she could have and this wrecked the whole film for me.This said, all three leads put in powerful performances although Kevin McKidd\\'s characters\\' transformation by the end goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful ethical triangle.This film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are lying on the bed. But do not watch further than this unless you have only a pinch, but several mountains, of salt.\",neg\\r\\n\"I am a huge Amy Adams fan and have been for many years. I am also a big fan of musicals. With that said this is not a good movie on any level. It is quite dull and the acting overall is very very poor. Amy Adams is awkward to watch act with Scott G. Anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting. All the performances come off as very amateur. The music performances are pleasant, but nothing special. Scott G. Anderson is just an bad actor! I assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice, but it\\'s just not the case. He has an average voice and sings on key, but that\\'s about it.I guess I can see why Amy Adams did this movie with the singing element I just wish she had not. I could rant about other poor elements of this movie, but I\\'ll leave it at that.\",neg\\r\\n\"I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw it theatrically. Randy Edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack. David Seville is the Chipmunks\\' father and recording manager. The Chipmunks consist of Alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, Simon, who is a bright and studious chipmunk & Theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss Miller, who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette & Eleanor, who all have the same character as the Chipmunks. My favourite songs from this soundtrack include \"\"Diamond Dolls\"\", The Girls of Rock & Roll\"\", & the touching \"\"My Mother\"\". Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there for business. The Chipmunks meet the Chipettes playing the Around the World in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing.\",pos\\r\\n\"The English Patient\\' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose sweeping epics such as \\'Lawrence of Arabia\\' and \\'Bridge on the River Kwai\\' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like \\'Lawrence\\', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war. The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes\\' Count Laszlo de Almasy - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like he\\'s English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers. The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you\\'re a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that \\'The English Patient\\' speaks directly to you.\",pos\\r\\n\"First of all \"\"Mexican werewolf in Texas\"\" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of Furlough in Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. And I guess it actually works because that\\'s the reason why I bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. Anyway the movie isn\\'t any good. Actually it\\'s bloody awful. But I didn\\'t expect anything else when I bought it. It\\'s a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. But I must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad.This movie has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. It\\'s so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. It\\'s like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. The worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. She\\'s the worst of them all. I have never seen an actor as bad as her (And I\\'ve seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies she can\\'t stop being a bimbo about it. I hate her.Some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. The ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movie is shot in the night when the Chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. The gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are pretty hilarious really, but that\\'s the way I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it\\'s easy to see that it\\'s a guy in suit.Overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it\\'s very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. I recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.\",neg\\r\\n\"Shemp finds out that he stands to inherit a million dollars IF he is married within 24 hours. Considering how hideous he looks and his personality, it isn\\'t surprising that he can\\'t get a taker--that is until an article appears in the paper explaining his predicament--at which point five crazed women appear from no where to claim their new hubby (plus the money, of course).While I don\\'t hate the Three Stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion, they never, even on their best day, came close to the brilliant comedy of Buster Keaton. That\\'s why I disliked this film, as it was a ripoff of the plot from Keaton\\'s masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges it wasn\\'t uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or just recycle older Stooge shorts. So, from the outset, this film is a pale imitation of an original. It\\'s also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced (paricularly the phone booth scene). The cousin Basil bit, however, was pretty cute and funny--though far from subtle! However, the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious--here, it all stayed in one small room and lacked comedic punch--ending in a fizzle.Overall, a dull retread. Also, before marking this review \"\"not helpful\"\", be sure to FIRST see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I am talking about--then you decide.\",neg\\r\\n\"Just saw this movie yesterday night and I almost cried. No, it wasn\\'t because it got me utterly petrified, no. It was absolutely HORRENDOUS! Sometimes, you see movies that make you wonder what will become of the human race in the near future - this movie is one of those. It\\'s as though the writer, actors, director, et al, just came together and copied and pasted scenes of their favorite horror flicks, zipped it all together and said \"\"hey, here\\'s Satan\\'s whip!!!\"\" After seeing this movie, I could not help but be tormented by the sight of people whom call themselves \"\"actors\"\"; waltzing around like they\\'re some kind of talented artistic interpreters... do not be fooled they suck! Don\\'t bother wasting your time or money!!!\",neg\\r\\n\"I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake. I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there\\'s far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock\\'s. Now, this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this movie are all too wrong. The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, particularly on Marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character. The bright colors make it look like a happy movie and, when horrific events take place in these color schemes, it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream.The second problem is the lighting. This is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting, but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the OPPOSITE direction. Most of the scenes are very brightly lit, even at times when it is illogical to do so because it\\'s at NIGHT!Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn\\'s performance. Yes, he does pull off Norman Bate\\'s awkwardness and madness quite well, I don\\'t deny him that. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show: the softness. There should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character, at least at first, which then fades away once we realize the truth about him. Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS!!!!There are a few good aspects of this film. Some of the performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but, unlike Janet Leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film, Anne Heche was given last billing in the opening credits.I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. I now wish that I had bought that book and saved the comment because, after seeing this film, that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen. There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original, and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet Zafroomulax. So many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way. Such as the scene in which Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow. Hitchcock covered these actors\\' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances, not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.In other words, my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that\\'s already been said. Like everyone else here, I reccommend you don\\'t waste your time on this film and get the original.\",neg\\r\\n\"For once a sequel to \"\"The Karate Kid\"\" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there\\'s gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process. That was very funny! And the classic \"\"Wax on, Wax off\"\" scene was different as well. It was funny when Miyagi tells Julie, \"\"Uh-oh, missed spot\"\". The set in Boston was a far cry from California. The Militant group in that group, was like the \"\"Cobra Kai\"\" in Boston. And Michael Ironside\\'s Col. Dugan was no John Kreese. His group practically deserted him when Julie kicked some serious butt. They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they\\'ll find redemption from Dugan\\'s poison. This Karate Kid sets some morals, unlike the last three, which talked about \"\"Honor\"\" and \"\"Respect\"\". Hilary Swank is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!\",pos\\r\\n\"If you think piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke\\'s film \"\"LA PIANISTE\"\" is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement, perversion and darkness, I\\'ve got news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek\\'s novel \"\"LA PIANISTE\"\" (on which the film was based) is twice as \"\"repulsive\"\", \"\"disgusting\"\", \"\"deranged\"\" and even more fascinating -- though there can\\'t be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that Isabelle Huppert has reached here, above all other mortal actresses in activity today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing/dubbing an actor could deliver?In the novel as in the film, there are two big antagonists to the \"\"heroine\"\" Kohut: her own mother (wonderful, wreck-voiced Annie Girardot, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria itself. The mother personifies Jellinek\\'s perception of her native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist/fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, let\\'s say, \\xc3\\xbcbermensch ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdown.\"\"La Pianiste\"\" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one (you think) you love. We tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which may turn out to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here, Kohut learns (?) the lesson in the most painful and humiliating of ways.It must be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the best-known and praised authors in Austria and Europe (well, now she\\'s got a Nobel Prize!) and that autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel, as she herself was a pianist and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes long passages about Kohut\\'s childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the film, forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way (don\\'t we all know a Erika Kohut out there?). But he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film: unbearable honesty, to the point where most secretive, \"\"horrendous\"\" feelings painfully emerge -- envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hate, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion etc. All of them unmistakably human.I thought \"\"La Pianiste\"\" was a deeply moving film, very disturbing and thought-provoking, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that\\'s just all I ask of movies. It also made me buy and be thrilled by the book, discover a fantastic author I hadn\\'t read before, and listen again and again to Schubert - so, my thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle!!! On the other hand, if you\\'re looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10\",pos\\r\\n\"I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films. I found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired.I went to bed, and no kidding I had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep. I couldn\\'t stop thinking about why, so I got up, switched the TV back on, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie.Well done Alex Frayne sir, you\\'ve managed to implant your film into this old, cynical movie goers head, and that takes doing.

Awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!Awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! Awfully inaccurate - the whole\\'mystical\\' side to this film was a joke, and last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn\\'t exactly a nice guy! Awfully acted - I found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth! A saving grace of the film was the cinematography. That is why I gave this film a 2 star-rating rather than the bare minimum! However, if you want to look at something pretty I would recommend buying a picture instead! All in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money! Please do yourself a favour and give this Mongolian turkey a miss!\",neg\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t really care for this.

Acting (if it can be called that), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, direction, camera work, it is all atrocious. There is not a single element that is done well.

The actual plot is kind of hokey (who would expect otherwise) but Hafron is so incredibly funny, and he delivers everything in a cyborgish voice so it\\'s easy for him. Whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely! I must have laughed out loud ten times, and that\\'s not a reason anyone would pick up this movie. The only softporn movie I\\'ve seen which had any merit other than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is drop dead gorgeous...just look at the cover!)Any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is, also considering the movie wasn\\'t made to artistically entertain, so to speak, it gets at least a four in my book.

For me, an idol has fallen.If you loved movies like \"\"Old boy\"\", the Mr & Lady \"\"Vengeance\"\" or even his short films on \"\"Three extremes\"\", don\\'t waste your time, the film\\'s not worth it.\",neg\\r\\n\"Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. I had expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, I can honestly say I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially.Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. To say that he just showed up would be an understatement. But at least he did show up. The rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various Los Angeles restaurants where they work as waiters. Talk about a cast of unknowns! This is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again. They act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment office.What about the special effects? Store bought firecrackers, Styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that look like they came from my 1980 Atari Game. I have seen some horrible special effects used on Sci-Fi Channel movies, but this stuff looked like cut-and-paste done at the kindergarten by someones\\' child. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge-Bob would show up at the end to battle the Chupacabra. Not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlin-like critter. It would have been a good film for a Leprechaun-like character. Instead, we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stop-action speeded-up effects that are laughable. The chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at super-speed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this.\",neg\\r\\n\"I hadn\\'t seen this in many years. The acting was so good as I began this time, I thought, \"\"Great! Another movie I misjudged as a foolish young man.\"\" But then the theme started to be clear and I felt the same way.This was Hollywood, the seat of glamor; so the concept shouldn\\'t be a surprise. But it is so condescending a concept I feel as if I need to take a shower after watching it. In brief, it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive.Dorothy McGuire is likable as the homely heroine. She seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make-up. Robert Young is injured in the war and feels scarred. His parents can\\'t bear to look at him either. He seems to have all his faculties and in part, the notions of disability are outmoded.Herbert Marshall is on hand as a blind pianist. His character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient.The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as the owner of the title residence. She is bitter and dour but not made of ice. Her story is much more interesting, and believable, than that of McGuire and Young.\",neg\\r\\n\"This is the one movie that represents all that is bad in the movie business. The actors are pathetic and the script is awful. The special effects, if there are any, are so badly done that it would have been better to do it with cartoons instead. Besides that it\\'s great! I think the creators of the movie meant it to have humor, but the only time i was laughing was when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and the colorful costumes that every one had. The scenes at the end were good but they were not a part of the movie. In the end you will ask yourself \"\"why did I waste my time and money with that crap when I could have watched the plants growing or the clouds moving\"\". I don\\'t think that I am some critic or anything but this is a truly lame movie! DO NOT WATCH! DANGER OF STUPIDITY OVERLOAD!\",neg\\r\\n\"Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are way below par, even if it were on a playstation 1, never mind a Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. What a worthless game!I totally love Warner\\'s Batman animation and it\\'s cool that they do all the games in this way. Batman: Vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the Gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. I really must stress how bad the graphics are. Don\\'t let the color schemes fool you.

YOUR FAULT), an expos\\xc3\\xa9 of the pre-Thatcherite aristocracy, as seen through the eyes of a low-rent \\'commoner\\' whose world view is transformed by his adventures amongst the Upper Classes. Unfortunately, Roy\\'s screenplay says very little we didn\\'t already know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is only briefly ignited by Leitch\\'s relationship with a handsome but self-destructive rent boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to emulate. Also starring Diana Quick (as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are \"\"embarrassed to be alive\"\"!), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson (\"\"EastEnders\"\"), Blake Ritson (DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typically flamboyant cameo, flashing her boobs at all and sundry, without a care in the world! Unfortunately, much of the film\\'s impact is diluted by Roy\\'s insistence on using a Triptych effect (three separate 1.78:1 images are letterboxed within the 2.39:1 frame, each one providing a different viewpoint of individual scenes), which shrinks the image and distances viewers from events on-screen. A long, pointless film, too personal for wide appeal, and hampered throughout by a cinematic process which fails to reconcile the story at hand. A single-image version is also available (framed theatrically at 1.85:1), with the on-screen title AKA: LIES ARE LIKE WISHES.\",neg\\r\\n\"If you take the movie for what it is worth, you won\\'t be disappointed. If you think Murray is supposed to win an Oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting, don\\'t bother. It was funny when I saw it in 1979 and hasn\\'t lost its charm. Good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks. The story line is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but this is his first film. The movie reminds me of a time when we didn\\'t need blood and guts to be entertained. Morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfect. The other counselors are typical revved up teens looking to have fun during the summer. One nice thing about this movie, it has a message.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is apparently intended for a young, evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For that I give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. It\\'s a decent movie to show a youth group, but I don\\'t think it will be very well received beyond that. For any other audience, I\\'d rate it lots lower.The reviewers that saw \"\"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\"\" in this were right on, though I didn\\'t think of that until they mentioned it. I was more reminded of a \"\"Chick Tract\"\", those little 3\"\" by 5\"\" gospel comic books. If Jack Chick ever made a movie out of one of his tracts, it would probably look a lot like \"\"Second Glance.\"\" It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth, but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very nice, somewhat passive, and squeaky clean, while all of the non-Christians seem to be bad people.Muriel the angel plays a major part, and he is the corniest, cheesiest character in the film. He is the most unlikeable angel I have ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I don\\'t know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly, or if he just struck me that way. (I admit that he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan\\'s love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie. Why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that I wish had been answered.But the movie does display positive Christian values, and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson.\",pos\\r\\n\"Great. Another foreign film that thinks it\\'s Fellini. On top of that, we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled people.I see no reason why we have to be inundated with these thinly disguised euthanasia commercials.I found nothing redeeming about this film. What can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on, in spite of some adversity. It does not take courage to commit suicide. That is the action of a coward. Sharing this \"\"wish\"\" with his woman simply inflicts her with the same illness he has. If this had been a film about a man\\'s courage to go on, in spite of his problems, similar to the Jill Kinmont story, that would have made it a great film.If you\\'re interested in seeing true courage, check out the movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident.\",neg\\r\\n\"This film was really terrible.However , it\\'s worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. I mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same \\'moves\\' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! I haven\\'t laughed as hard as I laughed at that for a long time.There were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that I found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end. 2 minutes later they run out again. What the hell was that for?? Also , the tiny white forklift that magically changed into a huge yellow digger was pretty classic. I\\'m led to beleive that this is because they used footage from the \\'carnosaur\\' trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey. I\\'m gonna have to see those now!The film is worth watching for a laugh or two , but if you dont find bad movies funny, stay away!\",neg\\r\\n\"Sometimes I wonder if today\\'s horror movies rely on human torturing to make people scared. If so, then there\\'s a sad future for horror movies. Dee Snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified, this movie does exactly this but not in a good way. Now there are some moments in the film where that there is a chance that Snyder is saving this film from falling into a hole but let\\'s be frank, this movie didn\\'t fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and Synder makes no attempt whatsoever to bring itself out of it. When you finish watching this movie, you are left sick, depressed, dirty, and insane. I have a feeling that was the intention of this movie. What is lower than dirt?\",neg\\r\\n\"Yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn\\'t take anything away from the film\\'s charm and wonder. It was shown as part of our town\\'s youth film festival and was the organising committee\\'s favourite. Which is not surprising. The subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings. I saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children. A film to watch, meditate, discuss and act upon.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is the worst thing ever created by humans. You think manos is the worst movie ever? It doesn\\'t even come close to this garbage. I dont even know where to begin. The \"\"russian\"\" commander and the rebel chic are the worst \"\"actors\"\" ever to appear in a movie. They make the sister in troll 2 look like Meryl Streep. The goofy faces the chic makes while she\\'s in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed. Then there is the oompa music during the prison break, the totally out of place love scene, the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene, the fake castro, the fact that everybody has either a headband and/or a bandanna on some part of their body, the goofiest rape scene ever filmed, and the worst acting ever put on film.

R. Geiger. Anti-nuke protesters who all looked like punk rockers of the late 1970s, and somehow became non-violent, (except for their leader, \"\"Splatter\"\") occupy the cities. Fraternity boys descend on the punkers to do some violence on them and turn them into victims. Bad acting and bad plot then descends on the real victim, you, the viewer. I gave this a \"\"2\"\" because a few sexual scenes at least give it MST3K potential.\",neg\\r\\n\"Spoilers ahead.2001: a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind\\'s eye long after the movie itself is over. It is a film that you could meditate on. The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer, it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part) the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it\\'s ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past. We see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation. An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it\\'s presence to tool-making and violence. They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia. The characteristics inspired by the monument\\'s appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence. Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it\\'s development. On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered. The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission. Most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings. The film has many outstanding sequences. As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding. Most memorable are \"\"Blue Danube\"\" and \"\"Also Spake Zarathustra\"\" (particularly appropriate given the film\\'s theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.) The cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film\\'s final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life. The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film\\'s central thesis. In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well. The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission\\' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution. The architecture of the film is also meaningful. The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie. The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce\\'s novel Finnegan\\'s Wake. It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it\\'s destiny is grand beyond it\\'s capacity to imagine. It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope. This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it\\'s invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it\\'s involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth.  In the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much. Hollywood\\'s view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one. But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it. The process of making this film used all of his creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie\\'s astounding climax. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence. 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience. Those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.\",pos\\r\\n\"PDQ Bach did it better. Much of \"\"Bach\"\"\\'s speaking part is letters written to various patrons complaining about the amount and speed of his payment. Anna Magdalena\\'s diary, mostly about the death of children and sundry other family matters, is an iota more engaging. The music is disconcerting: 17th century sized chapel orchestras and choirs producing 20th century concert hall sound. The overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show. J S Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. This film adds nothing. Netflix sent me 2 discs that wouldn\\'t play, so I streamed the movie. Clearly Netflix was trying to tell me something.\",neg\\r\\n\"Lame, ridiculous and absurd. My 6 year old son talked us into watching this rubbish. Tripe stereotypes and themes not appropriate for children. The antithesis of the commercialism of Christmas is not socialism it\\'s Jesus.\",neg\\r\\n\"Lana Turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister (Joan Blondell) makes for her.When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell\\'s beau, a wonderful George Murphy, in this film. As fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed with Turner but sees nothing ahead for Blondell except a job as the cigarette-girl. Not only does Blondell miss stardom, boyfriend, Murphy (Eddie) falls for Turner as well. So as not to hurt her sister, Turner is ready to marry the producer of the show, a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times.The story concludes as best as possible with Blondell taking a fast exit back to Nebraska. Look for Paul Ford, as a gossip columnist in the film. He is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner. The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondell could ever get together.Blondell, as the devoted sister, sacrifices both career and love, for her sister. This film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in Technicolor.Few realize that George Murphy, the future Republican senator from California, was quite a song and dance man in his day.\",pos\\r\\n\"Some of the secondary actors try, really hard. And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. Otherwise, this film is horrible.William Shatner\\'s character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He\\'s also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. Is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. Do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? Maybe they do.The film\\'s setup is way too long. We don\\'t get to the point of the story until well into the second half. The first half darts and flits among assorted characters.\"\"Shoot Or Be Shot\"\" is touted as a comedy, but I found it totally not funny. Dialogue contains no subtext. None of the characters are believable as real people. They\\'re all stick figures that perform \"\"action\"\" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. Indeed, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: silly, inane, birdbrained.I can understand why some actors are in this film. They need the money or the exposure. But what are insiders Shatner and Harry Hamlin doing here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy roles. Is this the best he can do? Is Hamlin that desperate for money? He used to be a respected actor. What happened?Even though the story is supposed to be a satire, it comes across more as a put-down of amateur screenwriters. Maybe that wasn\\'t the intent. But that\\'s certainly how the film can be interpreted. As such, the script was very, very poorly written.\",neg\\r\\n\"A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore. However, it is not an excuse for poor writing. It is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training.I also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. With that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, \"\"that was perfect\"\". I see better character acting on Canadian television.This movie had a paper thin plot, bad acting, poor dialog and holds no intelligent ideas at all. This simply proves to me that some independent films are that way for a reason. If your looking for a quick scare, rent anything else. Even the \"\"Cable Guy\"\" was a scarier film. After watching this film, I think i would have been better off watching a re-run on the X-files.\",neg\\r\\n\"Back in the cold and creepy early 90\\'s,a show called \"\"Family Matters\"\" aired and became an instant classic.The trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts to sarcastic remarks in it and you had yourself a lovely little stealing-is-wrong,parents-are-right-show. So that worked out fine, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: making the exact same show again.Here\\'s the difference though: \"\"Family Matters\"\" had Urkel. \"\"Step By Step\"\" has the guy from those \"\"Kickboxer\"\"-sequels nobody saw. He says things like \"\"dudette\"\" and \"\"the Dane-meister\"\", and somehow the audience is still not supposed to hate him. I mean seriously, \"\"dudette\"\"? How can you even get that across your lips?The rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole Winslow-bunch, combined with some more one-or-zero-dimensional characters, like the dumb guy (JT. Well, Eddie), the smart girl (Laura), and a pretty girl who spends her days looking pretty(in theory).The character development was just awful in this show. Grover and The Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Everybody just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. They weren\\'t worth much.Powered by a massive laugh-and-cheer tape stolen from something funny,this show aired for a whopping 7 years,which was humiliating for the competition.Although,you\\'ll have to note that this is the time where family sitcoms were pretty much all big hits,everybody just ignored their crappyness because well,it was the 90s,one more crappy show didn\\'t hurt.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie has made me upset! When I think of Cat in the hat. Im thinking of cat in the hat books. You know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children. Well, I though that this movie would be a lot like that! But much to my suprise was nothing like the books! Insted it is more like young adult humor movie. In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you\\'ll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres. I think in short this means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn\\'t because the movie has been opened. If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy.\",neg\\r\\n\"The very first time I saw this I recoiled in HORROR at what was being presented as modern, liberated women.Sorry, but I cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in NYC. It\\'s definitely not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said, they act like gold-digging hooches.This is not liberated womanhood and I\\'m glad it\\'s gone. 0 stars and just plain AWFUL\",neg\\r\\n\"I absolutely LOVED this movie as a child. I can\\'t seem to find it anywhere! I was mentioning it to some friends just the other day, and not a single one of them remembers it! Can anyone help me out? My older sister vaguely remembers it. There was also another movie I remember that was half live action and half animation, but I can\\'t remember the name of it. The characters were animated and the background was real...I seem to remember it being about a kangaroo, and I believe the setting of the film was in Australia. I\\'m going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood. Edit: I searched IMDb for this other movie and found out it\\'s called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was type in \"\"kangaroo\"\" in the search bar under characters, and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off! MAN, I love IMDb! Thanks!\",pos\\r\\n\"Okay, I sensed that a film by Mormons, about Mormons, for Mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but little did I know how so very painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. The Church\\'s official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film \"\"Cipher in the Snow\"\" which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70\\'s. Then there\\'s Neil LaBute\\'s disturbingly masterful ouvre....However, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didn\\'t focus on Mormons or any specific Mormon theology. Instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level. \"\"God\\'s Army\"\" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox. While this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted Mormon, director Richard Ductcher\\'s ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge \"\"God\\'s Army\"\" unwatchable by almost any standard.Dutcher\\'s own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you\\'re ever likely to meet. Of course the cast\\'s sorry performances aren\\'t helped any by Dutcher\\'s pathetic script. He should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the Church, but, as can be expected, he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. It should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the Church\\'s darker side are addressed with little other than faith. At one point an African-American missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 (some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep South had already done so). Instead of addressing the Church\\'s actively racist history, perhaps the sorest spot in Mormon theology which even Church leaders don\\'t defend anymore, Dutcher\\'s troubled character instead ponders Joseph Smith\\'s murder--an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. Top off this syruppy milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films.If you knew little about Mormons before watching this film, you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about.\",neg\\r\\n\"Snakes on a Train starts as Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) & Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the boarder into the US, they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to Los Angeles. However Alma\\'s family didn\\'t approve of her & Brujo\\'s relationship & placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes, ain\\'t life a b*tch? As the snakes pour out of Alma\\'s mouth & slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment...Edited & directed by the Mallachi Brothers (although the IMDb claims it\\'s just one guy using a pseudonym, Peter Mervis) one has to say that I thought Snakes on a Train was crap, it\\'s as simple as that really. It seems the entire film was set-up & made to cash in on the Samuel L. Jackson cult flick Snakes on a Plane (2006) by every horror fans least favourite production company the Asylum who specialise in ripping-off big budget Hollywood flicks & that style of money & film-making is no more evident than here with Snakes on a Train, making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point. The script by Eric Forsberg is rubbish, for a start Snakes on a Plane was great fun whereas Snakes on a Train is a lot more serious & when you actually break it down & look at it this should have been much more light hearted. In fact it probably would have worked better as an Scary Movie (2000) type spoof. You know something, I am struggling to find one positive thing to say about Snakes on a Train it\\'s that bad. For a start the character\\'s are rubbish & it\\'s impossible to emote with anyone, the story is downright awful & makes no sense (if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from? Why did Alma turn into the giant snake at the end? Why did Bujo kill the train driver? How was he going to stop the train once it reached Los Angeles? Where did that typhoon come from at the end?), it takes itself far too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes is so boring & uneventful I am surprised I stayed awake & it\\'s just a very, very poor film on just about every level.Director Mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive & dull to watch. There\\'s barely any blood or gore, there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin, someone gets shot & that\\'s about it. The special effects are rubbish too, the giant CGI snake at the end is truly awful & the least said about it the better. It\\'s not scary, there\\'s zero atmosphere & it\\'s a bit of a bore from start to finish. The real live snakes are a problem too, they are just so docile & nonthreatening. If you look at any scene featuring a real snake & an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively & in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction.Shot in California technically the film is obviously low budget & it show\\'s, basically it looks cheap because it is. The acting isn\\'t great not that the actor\\'s are given any sort of material to work with.Snakes on a Train is rubbish, I am sorry but that\\'s how I feel & I don\\'t quite know how else to describe it. I really can\\'t see what anyone would get out of watching Snakes on a Train, it really is that bad.\",neg\\r\\n\"If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you\\'re bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a \"\"thriller\"\" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to actually finish \"\"starting\"\". It never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all of the violence of \"\"No Country for Old Men\"\" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters. Thrill-killers run amok. The acting is good, mostly, but the script is a pile. Don\\'t bother, and tell your friends to don\\'t bother.\",neg\\r\\n\"I am definitely not a gamer, but a couple people in my family and my boyfriend are. So, a little reluctantly I decided to find out what the big deal was with \"\"fantasy stuff\"\". I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIOUS!

Also, and most importantly, people who\\'ve never gamed before can enjoy it and not feel left out or lost trying to understand the plot. The acting was great and the field shots/set were believable. This makes me want to see other movies by this production company. I can\\'t wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three cheers - well done!!\",pos\\r\\n\"I haven\\'t been a fan of Madonna for quite sometime now, however, I thought I would comment on this film.This film mistaken. One of them, as well as Madonna, was panned by the critics. They were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews.First, Madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the film, she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life. Most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn\\'t give her a fair shake. When you view this film I hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting. She was absolutely hysterical as was the film.Griffen Dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film. If you take a look at his filmography, you will see he is quite an accomplished actor.As far as the movie itself, this is something similar to pretty woman, but came 3 years before the Roberts, Gere success. It\\'s a goof-ball comedy with lots of site gags, slapstick and one liners. Some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor.I know this doesn\\'t tell you much about the movie, however, I hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie. It is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun.Peace.Gary\",pos\\r\\nThey\\'ve shown i twice in a very short time now here in Sweden and I am so very tired of it.

Put the two together and what do you get? A gigantic piece of trash, of course. Unfortunately it\\'s not trash in the good sense of the word either, as Deep Blood delivers more in boredom than it does in hilarity. To the film\\'s credit, it does actually attempt something bordering on a plot; but to take said credit away from the film - the plot is rubbish. It has something to do with a group of friends taking of an oath (of friendship) and then some Indian curse that manifests itself into a shark. Or at least I think that\\'s what was going on. Anyway, the majority of the film is padded out with boring dialogue and \\'drama\\', and the shark itself - which lets not forget, is the only thing we really want to see - finds itself in merely a cameo role. Or not even that since most the shark is actually stock footage! Despite being a trash genre, there are actually a lot of fun Jaws rip-offs; but with this one, Joe D\\'Amato makes it clear that he couldn\\'t be bothered to even try, and the result is what must be the worst Italian shark movie of all time. Avoid this dross.\",neg\\r\\n\"If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. This is way far from a real love story (Get the spelling right, Reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, Himesh getting imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ... If you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this one, especially the scenes where he howls in Mehbooba. If you despise the nasal twangs, and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of Reshammiya can do to you, then don\\'t miss this movie.I couldn\\'t stop laughing from the beginning till the very end. The only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography, locations, and a couple of the songs. Even then, until you are a die hard Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.\",neg\\r\\n\"I remember when \"\"The Love Machine\"\" was first released to theaters. I was a mere 13 years old, too young to see the much-ballyhooed motion picture release, but not too old to take my Mom\\'s paperback copy of the Jacqueline Susann novel to school and pore over the \\'naughty bits\\' with my schoolmates.Though I\\'m not sure what my problem was at such an early age, but I was very much into the book. I bought and wore an \"\"ankh\"\" ring just like on the paperback cover, and I remember the ads for the perfume, \"\"Xanadu\"\" that was cross-promoted and featured clumsily in the film. Despite such an interest I didn\\'t actually see the film until several years later. I should have left things as they were.\"\"The Love Machine\"\" is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from Susann\\'s novels...which of course makes it the most fun to watch. Its faults are many: from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread; its dated, horny (brass instruments, I mean) music score of ersatz Bacharach; the flat, first-take performances; the boring sexuality -I\\'ve never seen bathrobes featured so prominently in a movie before. It\\'s like a fetish! Whenever sex, nudity or something sleazy is called for, out pops somebody in a blue robe! Very odd, that; and most certainly, the circus train of awful 70\\'s fashions that are on endless display. Poor Dyan Cannon\\'s performance (which is no great shakes anyway, but heads over the rest of the cast) is consistently undermined by the jaw-dropping get ups she\\'s called upon to wear. However, the film\\'s chief liability is the stoic, stone-like John Philip Law as (appropriately enough) Robin Stone, the object of every girl\\'s (and one over\\xc2\\x96the-top flaming male photographer\\'s) affection.Law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street, handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot. Just lifeless! Not only that, but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something. He looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars. Robin Stone should be a hunk, not a hankie.For anyone finding the film hard going (it\\'s rather slow by today\\'s standards) I beg you to stick around for the climactic \"\"fight scene.\"\" Here Ms. Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of teased hair) finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers, setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now. Trying to rival \"\"Valley of the Dolls\"\"\\'s infamous wig-down-the-toilet scene, \"\"The Love Machine\"\" finally does something right.Jacqueline Susann\\'s unique brand of trash is sorely missed. Perhaps someone out there owns the rights to Rona Barrett\\'s \"\"The Lovomaniacs\"\" and will revive the genre.\",neg\\r\\n\"A space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space.

I mean it follows any number of typical sci-fi/horror plots. The genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film. But, when you start with a fairly typical horror convention, the legend of Dracula and vampires in general, and combine it with a fairly typical sci-fi convention, a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever they\\'re forced to confront, the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staples.Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this utter failure. So, no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing up their sleeves but their arms.This film begins ominously enough, with a very poorly delivered voice over by Caspar Van Dien, essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are. I should also point out that Van Dien\\'s character is named Van Helsing. And, oh so very cleverly, this Orloff character is from planet Transylvania in the Carpathian System. No kidding. I mean, come on guys, we get it. And, again, don\\'t be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store.So, after Van Helsing\\'s introduction of the crew, we have, essentially, a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about.I\\'m a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films. Occasionally, they can be brilliant, see Raimi\\'s first two Evil Dead films. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd stringers like, Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike, the EVIL DEAD flicks, there is no talent behind the camera. In front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but I\\'m going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt. It really seems like they don\\'t know what to do. The best actor of the bunch, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, gets killed off quickly and the ever-enjoyable Udo Kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal. Grant Swandby is also okay as the Professor, but it\\'s hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair. And, yes, it\\'s a WHEEL chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it. As for the rest of the actors, well\\xc2\\x85\\xc2\\x85.I\\'m sure Coolio really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire, but, well, I don\\'t think irritating qualifies as scary in most people\\'s book. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak don\\'t really provide much either. Lister is never really more then the IL\\' big brawny black stereotype. Eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid thirties, but looks a little worn out and uninterested for the movie\\'s duration.This brings us to Count Dracula/Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can\\'t recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be. He introduces himself as Orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as Count Dracula as well. Go figure. In any case, you will be absolutely astounded by just how lame this vampire is. Have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time slots? Yes, it\\'s that bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor playing Orlock, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. I\\'m sure he\\'s still getting hassled by his friends.There isn\\'t much to the plot. The vampire is the last of it\\'s kind and wants to go to Earth, for some reason, and also, there is some lip service about wanting to defeat Caspar Van Dien\\'s character, Van Helsing. Most of the crew get turned into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine. Yeah, that\\'s right, bullets, and yes, the year 3000. Keeping in that baffling vein, one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires, or vampire, since there is really never more then one threatening them, is filled with old Soviet posters and insignia and such. What the? There are also references to God/religion being antiquated systems. But these references only confused me. Did the Soviet Union make a comeback? Is there some point Roodt and Milborrow want to make with this? It never really goes anywhere, seems dumb and the posters, etc. just look cheap.On the positive side, the film is competently shot and edited. The cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it\\'s clearly done by professionals and, I had no problem with the special effects. The ships look like ships in outer space. Although, as I write this, I recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him. What were they thinking? Why didn\\'t someone say something? See how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives? I guess, ultimately, that\\'s the thing. Whatever positives you try and grant this sci-fi/horror debacle, you become overwhelmed by it\\'s lack of quality.Poor Udo Kier.\",neg\\r\\n\"In an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter\\'s 1982 opus THE THING, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director\\'s, Howard Hawks\\' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter\\'s film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.In fact, Carpenter\\'s film is less of a remake of Hawks\\' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story \"\"Who Goes There?\"\", in which a US scientific crew in Antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the director\\'s 1979 TV movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing \"\"thing\"\", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It isn\\'t long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS.Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante\\'s 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter\\'s film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren\\'t up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. When he\\'s not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey\\'s prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone\\'s classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2.Carpenter\\'s film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released Steven Spielberg\\'s far more family-friendly E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored Spielberg\\'s excellent film over Carpenter\\'s equally excellent but exceedingly different one). Also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention in its time.Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter\\'s film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. Though it is still quite gruesome, THE THING should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.\",pos\\r\\n\"I\\'ve seen many horror, splatter, monster movies in my life. And of course also a lot of monster movies from the 50\\'s and 60\\'s. When I first stumbled over this one I thought this is from the 60\\'s until I recognized it\\'s from 2007.In fact the character of Jack Brook is interesting and the acting all in all is for a splatter movie quite good, but.... I expected a splatter movie and not a drama story about a aggressive plummer. The movie runs 80 Mminutes and I think the first kill is after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story the reason where are the monsters come from takes at least 3 minutes... the we have another 20 minutes boring dialogue and finally a, in my opinion, not that well managed splatter sequence. Although we have Robert Englund starring here I only recommend this one to real hardcore horror fans.\",neg\\r\\n\"Francis Ford Coppola\\'s \"\"Apocalypse Now\"\" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film\\'s production levels.Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors \"\"The End\"\" as Martin Sheen\\'s Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard\\'s mission is to \"\"terminate... with extreme prejudice\"\" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is \"\"out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.\"\" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior.Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen\\'s raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man\\'s power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard\\'s slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz\\'s.Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn\\'t. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola\\'s actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man\\'s fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film\\'s 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola\\'s sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen\\'s haunted soldier Willard.I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today\\'s standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola\\'s masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend.That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis.\",pos\\r\\n\"This documentary attempts comedy, but never quite gets there for me. Camp? Ehn, maybe. The more apt word that everyone will agree on -- and have a hard time avoiding in any review -- is kitsch. It dripped kitsch. It was as if the film makers had worried their viewers would take the movie too seriously, and so they bent over backwards to insert kitsch and proclaim, \"\"We\\'re joking around here! See???\"\"In short, I felt it was trying too hard. For example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (to me) annoying when I\\'m sure they were meant to be amusing -- or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey.Do not, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just be ready to revel in kitsch rather than having it thrust at you unprepared. If you\\'re interested in lighthearted fare, you could do far, far worse. At the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the Bakers make this interesting and worth a view. At best, gaggles of like minded kitsch lovers will hoot and holler over choice bits throughout the film.\",neg\\r\\n\"These writers are trying to re-create the characters they have on \"\"scrubs\"\" in a different occupation however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems poor and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn\\'t so disgusting which is leaving the shows only lifeline to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive. The humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an I.Q. of 40 or below. Another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show \"\"scrubs\"\" is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together. This is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already.\",neg\\r\\n\"William H. Macy is brilliant as Everyman caught in a desperate situation. Starts off with a bang and never lets up. Twists and surprises are fresh, unpredictable. Use of film noir clips and frequent quotes and references to 30\\'s and 40\\'s flicks makes this a delightful \"\"must\"\" for movie buffs.\",pos\\r\\n\"*This comment may technically contain \"\"spoilers\"\" but it sure doesn\\'t contain surprises*My cousin and I rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie. Unfortunately, we didn\\'t get too many laughs, and we certainly didn\\'t get too many scares either.Plot outline: A plane containing a company head\\'s daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives, so the company head assembles a team of personalities, rather than skilled hunters, to recover it.For the first 3/4\\'s of the movie, things get pretty boring. It mostly consists of shots of Big Foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him, and passing it off as nothing. We also see several shots of the party through Big Foot\\'s point of view, and he apparently sees in thermal vision.To set up the plot, we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the sasquatches existence and actions. \"\"maybe he can dodge bullets...if he sees them coming\"\". Sure enough, we later see he can. \"\"There are many uncharted lands that the sasquatch may live in. Maybe this is one of them that was over-looked\"\". And obviously it is. \"\"Maybe the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members\"\". And sure enough, thats the case. Along with those scenes, there are a couple of \"\"Oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you!\"\" scenes, and sadly, they are among the scariest.Then, finally, people start dying. Well, 2 people at least. Plus, the bodies of past victims are discovered. The death scenes are pretty lame. It mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the Sasquatch grabbing them, then cutting to a different scene, but first, we are treated to some horrible screams off camera.Then at last, we get to see the protagonist\\'s final showdown with the monster. I gotta admit, I found it pretty exciting while it lasted. But alas, it\\'s pretty short lived, and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half assed effort to seem cryptic. Then, some closing text with a rather boring conclusion.I can\\'t say I recommend this movie. It\\'s not quite bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theatre 3000, and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie. Just don\\'t bother with it.\",neg\\r\\n\"First of all, I wasn\\'t sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn\\'t understand and find boring. There wasn\\'t really much to it, Bruce Willis wasn\\'t stretched as an actor at all. He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn\\'t bother. And if it\\'s the story you\\'re interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child), I would go to see About A Boy. It has everything this film lacked, humor, sadness and reality.\",neg\\r\\n\"The first Robocop had a sense of cynical wit and a sick sense of violence. It was a fine line to walk, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well, they made a sequel. How awful. (Possible Spoilers ahead - though anything that could spoil this is beyond me).Irvin Kershner is not the director for this type of film. He clearly did not understand the wit of the original and as a result the massive over-the-top senseless violence looks really bad - and worse is very distasteful. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic, light music does not match the images on the screen at all! What was he scoring?! The Great American Hero?! Worst of all, he completely eliminated Robocop\\'s theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman film without John Williams\\' fanfare, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that?!!The plot is just a collection of ideas that don\\'t gel. In beginning we see Robo \"\"stalking\"\" his old wife. Fine, good idea. But, they completely drop it after that. Then, there is this a stupid idea of the company reprogramming Robo to be nice. That\\'s thrown in for 10 minutes and then is immediately dropped. Or, the silly idea that the repulsive 10 year old drug lord reminds Robo of his son - Once again, a weak motif that is shown briefly twice and dropped. This may work in a comic book, but not on film and Frank Miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea in along with the kitchen sink. It doesn\\'t work as a whole.Some people here seem to be praising the corporate bashing in this film and the privatization of the police. That is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first. However, in the original, the old man was a tough business man out for a profit, but ultimately fair in the end. In this film, he is just pure evil in his lust for money and power. You can\\'t just change characters like that for no reason. And Nancy Allen\\'s character is useless in this film, whereas in the first she was essential to Robo\\'s search for himself. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this film.And the violence, yes the violence. I enjoy many violent, bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits, shot to pieces, children lusting for death and torture and peoples\\' desire for drugs. He doesn\\'t know when to stop. Do we really need to see every last innocent bystander (even people trying to help others) get shot up???? It is inferred when we see the bad Robocop shooting repeatedly! Instead Mr. Kershner proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse, a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film.No, this film isn\\'t meant to be message-y and I certainly don\\'t watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However, when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do must be put into question. And as for this film, in the words of the evil kid drug dealer\\'s last words as he dies, \"\"It still sucks\"\".\",neg\\r\\n\"** and 1/2 stars out of **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest films I\\'ve ever seen, so ridiculous, yet at the time it\\'s strangely compelling and never the least bit dull. Whether it\\'s due to the nonstop nudity, the large amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema.The spaceshuttle Churchill has been sent to investigate Halley\\'s Comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), has been sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (Mathilda May). They decide to take all three back with them, which results in a catastrophe.When London receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what\\'s going on. When they dock with the Churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dessicated beyond recognition. The humanoids are still in perfect condition, and they take them back to London.After various tests, the scientists still don\\'t know what these beings really are. Then, late one night, a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held. He touches her shoulder, and she awakens, stands up, and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner. She approaches him, and begins to kiss him, when it becomes clear that she\\'s actually taking his lifeforce, sucking him of all of his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy).She escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought in to track her down. Then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process. The corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours, and takes the lifeforce of a doctor. It seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of the Churchill\\'s sole survivor, Carlsen, they attempt to track the girl down before it\\'s too late.Lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment. It has all the elements one could look for in such a movie, loads of nudity, blood/gore, and plenty of special effects. This is certainly better than a similarly plotted film, Species, thanks in large part to a more riveting finale.The performances range from decent to terrible. Faring the worst is easily Steve Railsback, who overacts to no end. Much better are Peter Firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the gorgeous Mathilda May (she\\'s as beautiful as French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing, and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when she can be quite creepy, being simply seductive. Most of the film manages to work because of her.\",pos\\r\\n\"I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but having just sat through the film I felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children. Please don\\'t! This is no Disney film. This film tells us \\'life is cruel\\' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. The video box describes the film as a \\'delight for all ages\\' and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a \\'family film\\'. I just had to find a definition of \\'family film\\' and came across the following: \"\"Usually consisting of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children\\'s literature and can involve any number of helpful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds, all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination. Whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way.\"\" Not an apt description of Tarka The Otter, which contains some thoroughly unpleasant scenes, totally unsuitable for young children, and an ending that qualifies the film as a \\'feel bad\\' movie.

Jeez, this is bad movie heaven for REAL aficionados...\",neg\\r\\n\"\"\"There are some things you just don\\'t do\"\" so says the tag-line of this, a 2003 David Zucker comedy about a young man caught up in one horrendous situation after another entitled My Boss\\'s Daughter, and it\\'s the tag-line which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it. There are indeed some things you just don\\'t do, with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within My Boss\\'s Daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture. My Boss\\'s Daugther is a sordid; creepy; grotesque experience, a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. To see it is to endure it, to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself \\xc2\\x96 if any of the cast; writers; extras; Hell, even the guys that worked as runners on the set, aid in producing anything as Earth-shatteringly poor as this again, then it\\'ll be either because they\\'ve been sent here by the devil Himself to destroy the medium of film or, it\\'ll be because they\\'ve most probably garnered employment on behalf of the Friedberg/Seltzer mob.My Boss\\'s Daugther, (which I\\'m pretty sure ought to be titled \"\"My Boss\\' Daugther\"\", grammatically speaking), revolves around its hapless male lead, named Tom Stansfield (Kutcher), and a night in at his boss\\' house as he chases that seemingly elusive \\'goal\\' that is his young, blonde daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid) - someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering Chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of Jack Taylor (Stamp). Tom spies Lisa early on, she\\'s taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company. After trying to talk to her, but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in Tom\\'s crotch than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an after-dark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her - and yes, she does still live with her father. Think Hitchcock\\'s 1960 film Psycho with the gender roles between Norman Bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughs.The distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which Tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts. They are a ruthless and smarmy bunch, whom it\\'s made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush, without ever returning them. One day it happens with Tom there, and his wish is to return it, thus pounding into us that he\\'s-not-like-other-guys(!) This, as he first sees Lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position. This rather obvious and flat-footed attempt to try and get us to \\'side\\' with Tom sits uneasily with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these co-workers in this company.It is, however, as close as My Boss\\'s Daughter comes to any level of film-making. From a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from Hell. Tom\\'s arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead he is charged with house sitting Jack\\'s pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house. It\\'s been established Terrance Stamp\\'s character means business in the strictest of manners, firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee. It\\'s not that Jack is a shrewed businessman, he\\'s a cleanliness freak; obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land. You can imagine, that when we\\'re let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong, there\\'s obviously going to be trouble.The film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes. The first time someone uses the worktop to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top, you may smirk, but by the time half the house is wrecked and Michael Madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug, you\\'ve got your head in your hands. Each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and faultless, the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing the gears to a car as it clunks and creaks onto the next pratfall. Inbetween the gross-out wackiness, the film takes time to roll down a route of yucky, saccharine driven romance as Lisa and Tom bond whilst talking of in-workplace and out-of workplace persona\\'s, and that maybe they have more in common than first thought. By the hour mark, the film\\'s opted for gross out gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when there\\'s an entire scene that exists purely to target paraplegics and a dumb subplot to do with a head-injury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are unfolded. Throughout, Stamp\\'s character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them, to which the common-place reply ought to be whilst channeling Jack Taylor: was reading the screenplay first too complicated-a concept for you, Stamp?\",neg\\r\\n\"Simply delightful claymation feature from Nick Park and company spoofing such film-greats as \"\"King Kong\"\" and \"\"The Wolf Man\"\" has Wallace and Gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village..a giant were-rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens! What makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize. What makes the situation even worse is Wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable-eating rampage..he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops. What occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were-rabbit is created in the process..and it has more to do with Wallace than he could ever imagine. It\\'ll be up to his loyal(..and startlingly intelligent)and fast-thinking dog Gromit to save the day.This is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other Oscar winning claymation features starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing good ole-fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the CGI boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product. Here, we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation, not to mention gut-busting sight gags.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is truly a funny movie. His dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes I can recall. I thought the \"\"I am gay\"\" scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic, though it was funny. While watching it for the third time, I started to pick up on a little small segments that I had missed. One was when Matt Dillon\\'s girl friend, a classic ditz, tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this film successful along Tom Selleck. This was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds; she proved that she can be funny. She confirmed this in the TV series \\'Will and Grace.\\' One discovery that I found after the third viewing is Lauren Ambrose of \\'6 Feet Under\\' fame. She sticks out with her red bangs, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very funny at the high school principle.\",pos\\r\\n\"The title refers not to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic players. They come in twos: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple driving to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple who go along to share expenses, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as a sheriff and a hotel-owner in a tiny Nevada town. No attempt is made to fashion a coherent narrative\\xc2\\x97it\\'s a collection of comic bits strung together. All the first couple want to do is spend time together, but Burns and Allen\\'s characters aren\\'t married, so the men bunk together, as do the women. There is a bit of a plot: a bad guy plants $50k in the suitcase Pinky (Ruggles) is taking out of town, but because the expedition is being guided by Gracie, the loot cannot be found. The bad guy shows up in Nevada and Fields accidentally captures him. A bunch of pleasant bits, Ruggles\\' confused expression, Gracie\\'s batty, breakneck talk, and Fields playing billiards with a corkscrew cue and doing a fluttery, craven, backwards-stepping double-take when he\\'s threatened, and his wonderfully distinctive way of lingering over words. And trying to remember the name \"\"Gracie,\"\" he tells Skipworth, \"\"Hmm. Starts with a K... McGonigle.\"\" She answers, \"\"Oh no, no, no, no...\"\" \"\"Mmmm. Wangahanky!\"\" \"\"No, no, no, no no. Oh, Gracie.\"\" \"\"Yes, that\\'s right.\"\"\",pos\\r\\n\"I probably have to blame myself\\xc2\\x85but I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title \"\"Black Dragons\"\" and revolves on secret WWII conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed right before WWII and \\xc2\\x96 especially after witnessing the ending \\xc2\\x96 it surely is a premise with lots of potential, so it\\'s quite a shame it isn\\'t elaborated more proper. There is however one great dialogue that I can\\'t resist sharing! Man towards woman: \"\"Do you want to marry me?\"\" \"\"Why?\"\" \"\"So I can beat you up\\xc2\\x85it\\'s the only way you\\'ll leave this place!\"\" It\\'s the only highlight in an overall very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is lovely \\xc2\\x96 as usual \\xc2\\x96 but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film. If you\\'re interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his (in movies with decent screenplays), check out \"\"Invisible Ghost\"\", \"\"The Corpse Vanishes\"\", \"\"White Zombie\"\" and of course the 1931 Dracula version.\",neg\\r\\n\"This movie is not so good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. And some more info about the morticians would have made this movie far scarier than it is. Don\\'t expect a scary movie but a nice, gory special effects reel.\",neg\\r\\n\"H.O.T.S. is not for those that want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a precursor to many 80s era cult-classic college/frat films like REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY\\'S and a post-cursor to the world-renown ANIMAL HOUSE. A good time if you dig a lot of big-titted 70s/80s Playboy type chicks and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing too notable if you wanna use it as whack-material...H.O.T.S. is an \"\"unauthorized\"\" sorority of sexy outcasts doing battle against the popular and trendy Pi girls. This one has pranks, an Aunt Jemima-ish house keeper, and even an over-heated robot that makes it relatively fun viewing if boobies are your \"\"thing\"\"...Well...I like tits as much (or probably more...) as the next guy - but with all the sleazy sh!t that I\\'ve seen, I couldn\\'t help but wish for a few hardcore scenes to make this one truly worthwhile. I knew it wouldn\\'t happen, but I still wish that H.O.T.S. had a bit more sex and a bit less cheeze. Not quite as notable as NERDS, PORKY\\'S, or ANIMAL HOUSE, but worth a look for fans of those types of films...7/10P.S... and I forgot - this one has consummate douche-rag Danny Bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside of his \"\"reality show\"\"...\",pos\\r\\n\"It\\' s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by Star Fleet Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.)Dwight Schultz is miscast as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer\\'s character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a shallow, two dimensional figure from a soap opera. Paul Newman is also miscast as General Leslie Groves, but this movie\\'s problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles.The factual errors and great liberties taken (with the chronology of events) in order to advance screenwriter Bruce Robinson\\'s political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch. That\\'s probably why this movie has found a home on the so-called History Channel. \"\"Fat Man and Little Boy\"\" combine bad science, bad history, bad screenwriting and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by impressionable high school or college students who know nothing about the Manhattan Project.\",neg\\r\\n\"Please, If you\\'re thinking about renting this movie, don\\'t. If you\\'re thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips, don\\'t. If I had my way, nobody would even have to read this summary.The acting, despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic. The director was probaly a sadist. The witty one liners were something you\\'d expect from a room of highly paid anti-social 7 year olds that eat paint-chips for breakfast.The problem with this movie, is that it tries to be a movie like \"\"Evil Dead 2\"\"(do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies) in that it\\'s so bad it\\'s funny. But it also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly to do so, that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an attmept to save itself.I could go on for much much more, detailing just how awful it really was, but I think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it. If you need me, I\\'ll be off trying to boil myself so that I might feel clean again...\",neg\\r\\n\"The headline describes it exactly. This dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical \\'group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting/killing them off 20 years later\\' crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades. The only twist is instead of an angry ex-classmate or lovable psycho/loser, it was a nun. Nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls, blah blah, girls accidentally/purposely drown the nun, blah blah, nun haunts the girls, people die, movie ends. The only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes, which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat lady\\'s arms) but even they couldn\\'t make this a great movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse. I\\'m sure glad I rented it and didn\\'t buy it, or I\\'d be furious beyond belief. If you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses, go watch Demonia or something. Stay away from this garbage.\",neg\\r\\n\"Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever seen. There is nothing to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, and the joke isn\\'t all that funny. How many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? That\\'s not funny, that\\'s just pitiful. Nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong needs to stick to making Jackie Chan films, because it doesn\\'t get much worse than this.\",neg\\r\\n\"It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is in play, you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer, and on the cutting edge of quality. If your intention is to aim for second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? It is with that, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced, and aired. I would ask the producers, \"\"What were you thinking? Were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit?\"\" If perhaps the producers were thinking, \"\"We want to examine this biblical story from another point of view...\"\" Then I would say \"\"OK, I watched the show, now what\\'s the point of view?\"\" The premise of this \"\"possible point of view theory\"\" eludes me. I can generally watch programs, and (right or wrong) at least get a sense of what the creators were trying to accomplish. Not so, here. I recognize names such as \"\"Robert Halmi\"\" (the producer) and I can associate his work with some eye catching product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and the Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myth, history and comic book entertainment. A perfect genre for Sci-Fi Channel. So I still have to ask Robert Halmi...\"\"What was the point of THIS Ten Commandments, What WERE you thinking?\"\" \\xc2\\x85\\xc2\\x85\\xc2\\x85\\xc2\\x85FJS\",neg\\r\\n\"This is one of the funniest movies I\\'ve seen in ages. I watched for about 20 minutes, slightly puzzled by what was going on. Then I started to laugh and didn\\'t stop \\'til long after the movie ended. Such deadpan satire is rare indeed. Christopher Guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual males, to start with). As in \"\"Waiting for Guffman\"\" Guest nails middle America\\'s idiotic self-importance to the wall. I can hardly wait for his next film.\",pos\\r\\n\"I know, it\\'s a movie. But when it comes to portray real life (in any matter) it should be as faithful as possible. I\\'m sorry, but \"\"El Misterio Gal\\xc3\\xadndez\"\" isn\\'t as accurate as it seems. Nor is the Dominican Republic depicted as it really is. In fact, it shocked me to see that the filming location for Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And incredibly enough, movies with Cuban themes (Havana, The lost City, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather part II) were actually filmed in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot the movie in Cuba instead of the D.R.? The Spanish dialogs with the Cuban accent are horrible! Those are not Dominicans! On the historic level, Gal\\xc3\\xadndez would have never been hanged. He might as well been shot, decapitated or died from the inhumane torture he\\'d been receiving. Then, thrown his body in the Caribbean sea. But Trujillo would have never ordered death by strangulation. His sick mind wouldn\\'t have allowed it.Acting isn\\'t delivered as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he\\'s just expecting a paycheck. I prefer the leading actress in \"\"Deep Blue Sea\"\". The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban movie, and the same goes for the selected shooting location.I suggest \"\"La fiesta del chivo\"\" (The feast of the goat), from bestselling author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. It\\'s a bit more realistic with Dominican history. The Trujillo character is very well portrayed, and the Galindez incident is treated very briefly in this movie.\",neg\\r\\n\"Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i\\'ve even seen. Obviously this isn\\'t intentional though. It takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). It certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian. It is amazing that films like this get commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about \\xc2\\xa320 to make. ($40) I can see some guy pitching the film to a film company \"\"well there\\'s this big VOLCANO and it erupts in a CITY....pretty radical hey\"\" If you can find it in the dollar bins, maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good.\",neg\\r\\n\"This film is good,but not Schaffner`s best. My favourite is Papillon and Patton,but this is a sad and very nice film. Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference. I am going to miss Schaffner and this is his last film.A good film by a great director! 7,5/10\",pos\\r\\n\"Tim Curry was the reason I wanted to see this film, and while of course his appearance is always entertaining, he\\'s basically wasted in it. The rest of the cast doesn\\'t fare too well either, in this remake of an early zombie movie that has extremely graphic effects that are totally unnecessary. To quote a popular axiom, sometimes less is more.\",neg\\r\\n\"This wonderful film has never failed to move me. The colour, convincing cast, and stunning scenery all make big contributions. This production, unlike the later remake by Carlton, is more impressionistic, and presented more from the children\\'s own perspective. It focusses on certain episodes from E. Nesbit\\'s charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary \"\"warts-and-all\"\" style that Carlton adopts. Above all, the superb musical score of the late Johnny Douglas underpins the story throughout, adding extra emotional depth. The net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of \"\"The Railway Children\"\".One uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horse-drawn carts, but what about the quality of life in general? Consider the foul-mouthed celebrities who now \"\"grace\"\" our TV screens. Their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. Consider, too, the fragile \"\"here today, gone tomorrow\"\" aspects of so many of today\\'s \"\"partnerships\"\" plus all the single mothers - whatever happened to that institution called \"\"marriage\"\", when people accepted each others\\' flaws but still remained together, loving their children? These details add extra piquancy when watching this marvellous film.I hope that, as generations pass, children will still be able to enjoy this film. Not to mention certain adults!\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a good enough movie and you probably won\\'t be disappointed, but it again has Roy Scheider, right after he did \"\"French Connection\"\", playing a cop with the name \\'Buddy\\'. They also use the same too-memorable wheelman from \"\"Bullitt\"\". At first you\\'ll think you\\'ve seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory. The car chase is a great one, but as in many car movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. Check \"\"Puppet on a Chain\"\" and \"\"French Connection II\"\" for some other good, long, intense chases.\",pos\\r\\n\"A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. But the life scenes were attractive, it\\'s like observing than watching. It turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. It\\'s like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. Mr Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales did their roles so well that it\\'s more like telling us their own stories. Indeed they used their real names in the movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"It\\'s hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends. I have a bunch of Shasta Daisy\\'s in the back yard which I lovingly call my \"\"Chuckle Patch.\"\" My friends laugh at me and look at me like I have 2 heads. It would be great to see this series on DVD for us folks who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really WAS a chuckle patch! Where kids TV today is compiled of violent cartoons, characters who do magic, or a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea, The Magic Garden was real in the respect that it taught us good values.I will hold fond memories of Carole and Paula, and the Chuckle Patch.\",pos\\r\\n\"There has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called Why We Fight, which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation. It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq. Yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during World War Two, by Hollywood director Frank Capra. Although considered documentaries, and having won Oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of Leni Reifenstal\\'s Triumph Of The Will, scenes of which Capra recycles for his own purposes. That said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two documentaries (such as the BBC\\'s lauded The World At War) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. They are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store, I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase. I chose Goodtimes DVD\\'s four DVD collection of the series.Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. While there are no extras on the DVDs, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of Americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic Warner Brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. The seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are Prelude To War, The Nazis Strike, Divide And Conquer, The Battle Of Britain, The Battle Of Russia, The Battle Of China, and War Comes To America.Overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like X millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria. Yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. The lesson of World War One (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to World War Two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since: Korea, Vietnam, nor Iraq. The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today\\'s information-clogged times. It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you\\'ll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.\",pos\\r\\n\"My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I\\'ve seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. Texas is a big state - with LOTS of small towns - and of course, plenty of teenagers who grew up as \"\"fat girls.\"\" I know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were awesome - they were so great in these rolls, it was like the script was written with them in mind. And speaking of the script, it was very well written (very believable), and Ash is a great actor (his facial expressions alone made me giggle). It IS an independent film - but don\\'t let that fool you...It\\'s a good one! Seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring.\",pos\\r\\n\"My entire family enjoyed this film, including 2 small children. Great values without sex, violence, drugs, nudity, or profanity. Also no zillion dollar special effects were added to try to misdirect viewers from a poorly written storyline. A simple little family fun movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we only got to hear a portion of the songs ... Mostly during the end credits... Would love to buy a sound track CD from this movie. This is my 4th Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as mentioned above. With all the movies out there that you don\\'t want your kids to watch, this Hillman fella has a no risk rating. We love his movies.\",pos\\r\\n\"Ahhh...the \\'80\\'s. 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in America. Fresh off the \"\"Do What Feels Good\"\" \\'70\\'s, \"\"The Last American Virgin\"\" comes as a wolf in sheep\\'s clothing as yet another \\'teenage sex comedy\\' from the glory days. Oh sure, there\\'s sex, but, I can\\'t think of another movie--OK, this and \"\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\"\"--that really wasn\\'t killing time between topless teenage scenes--there was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavage.The movie follows three hormonal friends. Gary (wanting to lose his virginity), Rick (stud incarnate), and David (overweight, but, not inexperienced) as they try desperately hard to make sure Gary joins the world of manhood. But, a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger--Gary falls for Karen (pretty brunette who loves the bad boys), and can\\'t seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that David and Rick can facilitate. Only trouble is, Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen skips a period. It\\'s Gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion, and it\\'s Gary who truly cares. But, who is Karen dancing with by film end...Rick. Subtract the \"\"R\"\" and add a \"\"D\"\" where necessary.What separates this film from others from the \\'80\\'s we think about is that, by god, they attempt some real drama here, and not of the \"\"my parents just pulled in the driveway variety.\"\" And, you know what? I bought it.It wasn\\'t sloppy. It wasn\\'t far-fetched. And, when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at the house party at the end of the film, I actually felt sorry for the guy. Our teenage Romeo actually believed in unrequited love--and when his heart was broken at the end, it all sort of touched me.So, all the T&A aside, there\\'s an actually pretty believable and engaging story here. Oscar worthy? Not by a mile, but, I don\\'t know that I\\'d lump it into the \"\"let\\'s get laid\"\" category, either. Like \"\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\"\" they actually were trying to do a true film here, letting the hi-jinx in between fall where it may.\",pos\\r\\n\"The songs are fantastic and the story-line is good. Like many other acting schools, mine also produced HAIR. For most hair production it\\'s a golden opportunity to do nude, but my production was fully dressed... I don\\'t think full frontal nudity in a movie or a play guarantees artistic quality... And so did the creators of the movie. The movie version is great with classic hits following each other while letting the plot develop to the chilling climax. A great cast of actors, dancers and singers.\",pos\\r\\n\"Wesley Eure is young inventor Brian Foster, who\\'s invented a new crime busting security device in the form of a robot dog, the titular \"\"C.H.O.M.P.S.\"\" (It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., who\\'s been modeled after Brian\\'s real dog Rascal, can do just about anything; he\\'s got enhanced speed, strength, X-ray vision, and the like. It\\'s just the thing to save his boss Ralph Norton\\'s (Conrad Bain) security company. Naturally, a slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the edge so he tries to get his hands on the secret.This is the kind of thing that\\'s just too hard to resist. It\\'s got plenty of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots), an upbeat attitude, an engaging cast, and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music gets repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is straightforward, and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In one thoroughly odd but side-splitting touch, there\\'s another dog in the film (named \"\"Monster\"\") whose thoughts we actually get to hear; both his dialog and the performer doing the voice are priceless. In fact, he even utilizes some mild profanity and his last words end the film on a positively gut busting final note.Eure and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very likable young leads, and their veteran supporting cast plays the material with all the gusto they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis, and Regis Toomey also co-star.A rare theatrical live-action venture for the cartoon-creating team of Hanna & Barbera (\\'The Flintstones\\', \\'Scooby-Doo\\', \\'The Smurfs\\', and so on), \"\"C.H.O.M.P.S.\"\" is agreeably silly stuff. I know it left me with a smile on my face.7/10\",pos\\r\\n\"I have seen this movie since I was a little girl, and being from New York and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories. This movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person, woman, and provider Claudine attempted to be. It was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation. It was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and it was well deserved. If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments, enjoy Claudine. Your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind, and understand the overall frustration.\",pos\\r\\n\"First of all, i am from munich, where this movie takes place, and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including the silly dialect! I know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was, that the movie is just an assembling of their already known jokes, but it is not! The jokes are evolved through the story, and make, in their own special way, sense. But if you absolutely dislike Erkan und Stefan, hands of this movie. Everyone else - it\\'s worth viewing!\",pos\\r\\n\"Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it\\'s a WWE movie it\\'ll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie. It shows Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and creepy it is. He feels pain, something that Jason never does or appears to show. He feels sorrow and pleasure, though again both of them insane which you will notice if you see the movie. All in all, a different experience in my opinion than many slashers, and it surprised me in a few ways, as in who lived in the end.\",pos\\r\\n\"I don\\'t watch very many \\'horror\\' movies, but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins. Now, we\\'re teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here really wasn\\'t very good, especially at the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany, \"\"This is so... high school!\"\" while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with their High School name on it... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny, badly-written, badly-acted Lizzie McGuire episode. However, as the story progressed, and the cast moved on to just about only Jill most of the time, I was able to appreciate the movie more. Camilla Belle did really well in this movie, and I think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her. And I must admit, this was one of the scariest movies I\\'ve ever seen. Well, no, there weren\\'t big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen. And this movie really reminded me of what really IS scary... We all know we\\'re not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives, but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you\\'re babysitting at could really happen. The only flaw with this movie is that it\\'s one of the most clich\\xc3\\xa9 movies I\\'ve ever seen. It has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had- turning the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream, etc. At the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, I would give it a 7/10. It\\'s definitely worth seeing.By the way, This is my first review, so I don\\'t know if any of those things were spoilers.. But just to be safe...\",pos\\r\\n\"I cant see how some people cant find this film funny i saw the end of it on Sky Movies in 2001 thought i would by the DVD since then i have laughed my balls of with lines like Rik Mayalls laugh \"\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\"\" and Eddies \"\"Hello night porter\"\" when they never get any phone calls overall i think this film is very very funny.\",pos\\r\\n\"I think that Gost\\'ya Iz Buduschego is one of the best Russians minis for teens. I think i were near 6-8 parts of the movie. \"\"One boy form 6th grade found a time machine in the old house where nobody lived. And he goes to the 21st century, just 100 years in future. In future he meat pirates, they tried to steal a \"\"milafon\"\" - machine to read minds and a story started...\"\" Soundtrack for that movie was very popular in Soviet Union. Everybody loved that movie which was on TV every year.\",pos\\r\\n\"I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it LOOK LIKE FILM in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. Is that not what films are supposed to be about!? But it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests May Thomas is onto something we should pay attention to. For independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive, a lot can be learned from watching this film, technically it has everything going for it, the use of light, music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise. The actors performances are believable to a point, if not slightly under played, i felt there was much more in there, more depth, in particular from the male lead John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really does bother me, as a film maker myself, is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour? Do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? Or is this the future of wonderful, affordable film making?\",pos\\r\\n\"The \"\"Hunting Trilogy\"\" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the \"\"greatest\"\" or \"\"most important\"\" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I\\'ve ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it\\'s his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made.\",pos\\r\\n\"Hitch is a light-hearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances. Will Smith turns in a believable performance as a cloak and dagger Date Doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. Smith was excellent, never schmaltzing it up too much.The best piece of acting goes to the actor (don\\'t know name) playing this accountant who has fallen for this woman who is out of his league. This actor did an excellent job of character development as he listens to Smith\\'s directions, but in the end, just can\\'t help being who he really is.And in the end, that\\'s the main message of this film. Be who you are in love, and you\\'ll be OK.At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive lady and the Date Doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman. Don\\'t know her name, but she was pretty good too.Overall, this was a delightful, light movie that is definitely worth seeing.\",pos\\r\\n\"\"\"Five Characters In Search of An Exit\"\" clearly has to be one of the more clever and better \"\"Twilight Zone\"\" episodes ever made because of it\\'s abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and it ends as a surprise. You have a military major, a female dancer, bag pipe player, a clown, and hobo who all awake together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they don\\'t know who they are. So the episode starts out with very interesting drama and suspense from the very beginning making it so soul searching for the viewers interest to want to know the characters true identity and backgrounds. Plus the episode even adds more intrigue for the fact it places different types of characters with different views and lifestyles all with one goal in common to escape and find identity, and peace that\\'s very compelling for the viewer. Only in the end I don\\'t want to spoil for those who haven\\'t seen a surprise fall happens! Proving that many times you might want to stay where you are away in your little sheltered world and be away from the masses of other people\\'s world as you will see the characters are loved in a different way by people in a much different form. Really great and cleverly done a real shock twist surprise that makes the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that happens sometimes when you search and seek.\",pos\\r\\n\"An amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat. Brilliantly orchestrated in its timing, and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. The acting was generally well-done (the \"\"Director\"\" should\\'ve asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons), and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio). This movie didn\\'t let up since the opening scene...\",pos\\r\\n\"CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) gets to see his first secret location interrogation when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of having contact with a known terrorist bomb maker. Anwar\\'s wife (Witherspoon) is frantic regarding the whereabouts of her husband .Don\\'t you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? I must have an old edition as this Rendition is not a musical piece. No, it\\'s the government\\'s way of legally taking a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the desired information. While watching this movie I was reminded of a similar story line in the Crossing Jordan TV show (now off the air), and I expect we will see even more of these story lines. It\\'s inevitable. The events of 911 are the catalysts. This is a tough one to watch because we don\\'t like to see people tortured and our government not telling the truth about things. We like the idea that no matter what happens or happened that we can go somewhere to find answers, but when that door is closed to us, we are truly lost and without hope as Anwar\\'s wife was. Performances by all were first class and it\\'s possible we may see more of Igai Naor (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because he resembles and can act like Telly Savalas. No kidding.

The strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare\\'s plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. And, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night\\'s Eve and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. And the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming coming of age movie.\",pos\\r\\n\"I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson\\'s performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery. I\\'d rather watch this than \"\"To Sir With Love\"\" any old day!\",pos\\r\\n\"Mom has to be one of the all time uncomfortable movies to watch. It features an elderly lady you would love to have as your Nanny who becomes the nastiest mother f***ing monster you would ever want to meet on a dark night!This supper Nanny eats the inners of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it just gets sicker as it goes on. A cross between the howling and brain dead seem to come to mind when describing Mom!A must for horror fans who have the stomach for it (if you have watched re-animator or brain dead, this will float your boat)and are willing to switch the brain off for an hour or so...Let the gore pour!...8/10\",pos\\r\\n\"The DVD release of this superior made for TV BBC drama is a more than welcome addition to my collection. Great acting, gripping story, and wonderful direction all add up to one of the best BBC dramas in years.\",pos\\r\\n\"I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before seeing the video version of the show. While nothing can compare to actually being there, the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor, the feel, the sensation and so much more. The wonderful performances of Saltimbanco\\'s stunningly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout. The video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself. A wonderful experience.\",pos\\r\\n\"This movie is based on the game series: Final Fantasy. This one particularly is about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game, and I was very happy to see it be transformed into a movie, I loved the CG, that was awesome. Lot\\'s of great fight scenes, action, and characters to make the movie memorable. If your a die-hard fan of the game you will love this movie. Personally, I\\'m not a die-hard fan of the games, but I am starting to become one.My favourite character out of Final Fantasy VII besides Cloud, would have to be Cid. I love Cid, I think he\\'s cute. I was amazed how real the CG images were, it was amazing, it\\'s the game in 3D. I had a great time watching the movie, and by the way, I love the aeons to, especially Bahamut, he\\'s great! Overall I gave this movie a 9, because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really really good movie, and yes it\\'s on my list of movies to get. The characters were amazing, loved the CG, story was wonderful, with lot\\'s of action and fight scenes. All-in-all, it\\'s the best movie I\\'ve seen yet, based on a video game.\",pos\\r\\n\"Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, and anime all at once. The robots are actually called \"\"replicants\"\", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for \"\"heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal\"\"....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films. The hilarious climax involves the two leads morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus for a head, who personifies \"\"destruction\"\", which has been the path of both characters thus far, their individual minds and later literal heads functioning as something like testicles. The film ends with the mayor f*&%ing his free jazz playing boy lackey as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them, the last words of the mayor \"\"Oh f*&%\"\", followed by a quick fade to black. Part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly I was just laughing. A lot of the film is quite boring though, the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow. Takashi Miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films, and this film with the exception of \"\"Gozu\"\", reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two pretty basic themes, but like Cronerberg(who the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala Naked Lunch)Miike is able to show where the two connect, to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect.\",pos\\r\\n\"this movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better. holmes is protecting an inventor in switzerland and is on the trail of professor moriarity, who has become a nazi. this is a better version of holmes in a WWII world. rathbone does a great job with holmes as a spy and a detective. see this if you liked the voice of terror.\",pos\\r\\n\"This is a very \"\"right on case\"\" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face. I\\'m a Christian and liked the film in one way. It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see. It can be a bit long-winded, but the film has some quite nice cars that rescues it from a lower rating from me. As a Christian film it was quite good, but maybe a bit right-on in the message. The film works best on a big screen. *SPOILERS* The fighting scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the Christian thriller \"\"Mercy Streets\"\" starring Eric Roberts.*End of Spoiler* I give it a 7/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"I loved this film almost as much as the origional version!What teenager DOESN\\'T go through what Scamp\\'s going through;wanting to find independence by getting more and more distant from your family?The songs were nice to,and the character designs were great.Lady and Tramp look almost exactly like they did in the origional feature.They did a good job on the voices of those two,too considering the fact that the origional voice actors are probably dead.However,I do think they should\\'ve given more lines to Lady,Annette,Colette,and Daniel.Oh well;at least they had the common sense to keep the same scenery from the original film.\",pos\\r\\n\"For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is or was, it was a children\\'s reality show about real kids living at summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. It was full of romance, friendships, fights, overcoming your fears, and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months. It was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t.v. regularly, but is amazing non-the-less. The show was never dull and always attracted my attention. It\\'s really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it\\'s like before going. Plus Disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that\\'s at a camp for like only a week. The length of the camps where perfect for this show, and the environment they where in was fantastic. They where camps all over the U.S., that each provided unique activities for the campers. It was a truly amazing, unscripted show.\",pos\\r\\n\"This 8 minute gem is not only timeless, but it is a cartoon milestone. It is Mickey\\'s third cartoon, and one of his best ones too. It is a cartoon milestone because it was the first one with sound. And my goodness, even after 70+ years it is ever so good, and gives real additional weight to the narrative. The black and white animation is excellent, and the character features are convincing enough. The music is wonderful, I love the soundtrack, it does add to the fun the cartoon has, no matter how thin the story sometimes is. And the cartoon is funny! So many memorable moments, like the cow\\'s teeth being used as an xylophone and its udder as a bagpipe. The characters are also engaging, Mickey and Minnie two landmark Disney characters are well voiced by Walt Disney, and Pete serves well as \"\"the villain of the piece\"\". All in all, \"\"Steamboat Willie\"\" is just a timeless gem that everybody should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox\",pos\\r\\n\"Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he\\'s operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They\\'re all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what\\'s known as a weepie or a woman\\'s film. It\\'s beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. There\\'s tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of). The great acting by Gere and Lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn\\'t really about much. Every single bit of the plot is predictable. I rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. Also it\\'s far too short--I didn\\'t believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If comes out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly. Still the movie does work. The inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and I was in tears by the end along with most of the audience. So it\\'s a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. It doesn\\'t deserve all the criticism it\\'s getting. I give it a 7.\",pos\\r\\n\"So I guess that Bud and Lou just liked to mess with classic stories (although they did have some interesting results). In this case, they\\'re baby-sitting a bad boy, and Lou tries to read him \"\"Jack and the Beanstalk\"\" but falls asleep and dreams that he\\'s Jack and Bud\\'s the butcher, and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and princess from the giant (Buddy Baer).I think that my favorite scene was when Lou was trying to make the giant an omelet, and...well, I\\'ll let you see what happens. As this was an Abbott and Costello movie, they did have a few unnecessary songs, but other than that, it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of the classic story, \"\"Bewitched\"\" and \"\"Gilligan\\'s Island\"\" both had episodes portraying it.\",pos\\r\\n\"Redo the Oscars from 1992, and this film might get nominated, or even win. It was SO good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then, this film will show you. As an American, you\\'ll feel like you tagged along for an extended Japanese vacation, and by the end of the film, you\\'ll be a die-hard Dragons fan, as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into their baseball, much as we have done with our culture in our own game.Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a slumping, aging Detroit Tigers\\' slugger who is traded to the Dragons, perennial runners-up to the dynastic Yomuri Giants, Japan\\'s answer to the Yankees. The Giants are admired for their success, yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them, something which is rarely done. The Dragons\\' manager recruits Jack as the final piece of the pennant-winning puzzle, and we\\'re left with what could have been Gung Ho on a baseball field, but instead was much more.The casting was outstanding: Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can carry a film as well as he did his television show, and the Japanese cast was equally good, down to Mr. Takagi from Die Hard back as the image-conscious owner. The other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the manager\\'s daughter), strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in Japanese traditions, beyond what was forced on her. She is a proper and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizing with Jack for what he endures from her, and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to love.The baseball scenes are great, bolstered immensely by a pre-fame Dennis Haysbert as another American ex-patriate and Jack\\'s western mentor. The usual fish-out-of-water elements are there, and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with Jack to fit into a country that doesn\\'t speak our language, and doesn\\'t practice our ways, yet copies everything we do, including our national pastime. one of the funnier scenes occurs when Jack, clutching a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in Japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss, and it can\\'t be used against you, and exercises that right very humorously. The plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end, but not too neatly, and nothing concludes unrealistically.To call this a comedy is misguided: it\\'s a pure comedy-drama, or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film. The situations were amusing, but in their place against a far more serious, profound, and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films I\\'ve ever seen. The baseball cinematography rivals that of For Love Of The Game, for realism.Some say the film is about baseball, or about Japan, but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace, and how people arrive at work from totally different origins, with different agendas, and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company, or the team.A truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters.\",pos\\r\\n\"I first saw this movie at a premiere-party in Mr. Zwarts hometown Fredrikstad. There, between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities I laughed and laughed... I just couldn\\'t stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and excellent acting - this is one flick you HAVE to see! It\\'s like mixing \"\"True Romance\"\" with \"\"The Wedding Singer\"\" and add a dash of \"\"Mad about you\"\" Hilarios!10 Points!\",pos\\r\\n\"\"\"Campfire Tales\"\" is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic \"\"Hook\"\" story, and then we\\'re introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert. They crash their car, put out some flares, and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator, and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the eerie tales, each story becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come...In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine, frightening effects. The first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. The second story built a lot of suspense, more than either of the others did, but it\\'s unoriginal plot was it\\'s downfall. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was like eight years old on HBO and the third story scared the crap out of me, although it\\'s not scary to me now. You\\'ll probably recognize some of the cast here, particularly Amy Smart from the opening \"\"hook\"\" interlude story, and Christine Taylor as one of the main actresses in the film. The twist ending was kinda interesting too, I know I didn\\'t see that coming, I thought it was all cleverly pieced together.To sum things up, if you\\'re looking for a horror movie that is worth the while, rent this, you should be happy. It\\'s a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film was tied together neatly. It is much better than what one would expect. 7/10.\",pos\\r\\n\"I just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it. The synopsis was listed in our program as \"\"an old Shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party\"\". I wasn\\'t sure if I was going to see it because when I read about it I liked the idea of a \"\"suicide party\"\" it sounded very interesting to me, but \"\"old Shakespearean actor\"\" had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring. But I decided to give it a try. I am glad that I did. It was not dry and boring in the least, that dialogue was great, funny in a clever way, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was terrific in this role, he stole the show. I also was pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo\\'s performance, usually she bugs me, but I enjoyed watching her in this film very much. I think Judge Reinhold\\'s part could have been done better by another actor, at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting, not like you were just watching this character. But the movie was so good I was able to forgive one actor\\'s awkwardness. I would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public. Who knew suicide could be so hilarious?\",pos\\r\\n\"It\\'s out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(Anderson\\'s eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), Anderson\\'s unable to speak Russian was a ridiculous tell......That\\'s why I detest Anna Anderson and her confederates so much. Not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.Yet to some extent I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days. And to impersonate another woman for 60+ years is an arduous task for anybody.She had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of Anastasia\\'s, and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem.Anna Anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track. Had she put her good-looks, learned elegance, endurance, acting skills into proper use, she could of made a first-class actress.On a side note: Some main characters of this two-parter seem to be loosely based on real figures. Prince Erich could be a mixture of Gleb Botkin(believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme), Duke George and Dmitri of Leuchtenberg, and several other figures. And Darya Romanoff seem to be based on the gorgeous Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike the real confederates, Prince Erich was motiveless in this show and supported Anna out of love for and sincere belief in her, which is touching.On the whole this is a great show. Fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality. The power of Amy Irving\\'s acting lies in that she successfully represented Anderson\\'s self-assuredness, the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing. Just as Princess Xenia said about Anderson:\"\"She was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part.\"\" Highly recommended.\",pos\\r\\nMichelle Pfeiffer stars as a mob widow who seeks a normal life but has her hands full with the new boss and an undercover agent. A lighthearted Demme film with some good laughs and Pfeiffer in a comical role that she has fun with..on a scale of one to ten..8,pos\\r\\n\"This film tells the stories of several couples coping with Post-WWII life. Through many moving accounts the audience learns how the War has changed people, while their human spirit went on to triumph.My favorite scene is where a young service man, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms up to the elbow) is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him. His girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn\\'t be able to do, but that they would be fine together. Moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his fianc\\xc3\\xa9e in tears.The scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When he is initially refused as a \"\"high risk\"\", a higher ranking bank official takes over saying \"\"You fought for our country and kept us safe--that\\'s good enough for me. Your loan is approved!\"\" \"\"The Best Years of Our Lives\"\" won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living, even with a severe handicap. This film is a joy to watch over and over again. A true classic! Highly recommended!\",pos\\r\\n'}"

Obviously, It was first conceived into this world for the stage, but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively. There is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it. All in all, though, A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact.\",\n          \"I've watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now. When I came across it on DVD, I didn't hesitate too long, even more, because I have a predilection for early Belmondo flicks. But what a bad surprise! Some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to preserve a certain memory, and not to shock audiences.Widely hailed as one of Chabrol's rare cynic works, the only lasting impression I got from re- watching it is... boredom. Some movies really do not age in style. But what about movies which didn't have any sense of style at all?The flaws in the script, uninspired acting - presumably due to the lack of direction -, a sort of production design, which doesn't deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and, last but not least, the worst editing job I've seen in ages, make this one truly hard to stand.My impression was, that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously, no idea or any skills at all. It really comes as a surprise, that this one didn't abruptly end Chabrol's career. Don't blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s, this one is crap in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.\",\n          \"Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would've given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai, India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew. I have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there. Excellent work! Though the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such a work was never attempted on Indian Screen. Overall the movie is great! And hats off to Mr.Maniratnam.Mani Ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this film again and again.
